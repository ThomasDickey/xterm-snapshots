.TH KOI8RXTERM 1 "__app_date__" "__app_version__" "X Window System"
.SH NAME
koi8rxterm \- X terminal emulator for KOI8-R environments
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B \*n
[
.I xterm-options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B \*n
is a wrapper around the
.B xterm(1)
program that invokes the latter program
with the \*(``KOI8R__default_class__\*('' X resource class set.
All arguments to
.B \*n
are passed to
.B xterm
without processing; the
.B \-class
and
.B \-k8
options should not be specified because they are used by the wrapper.
See the
.B xterm
manual page for more information on
.IR xterm-options .
.PP
The environment's locale settings (see \*(``ENVIRONMENT\*('' below) are
used to discern the locale's character set.
If no current locale can be determined, the locale \*(``ru_RU.KOI8-R\*(''
(the Russian language as used in the territory of Russia, with the KOI8-R
character set) is assumed.
The
.B locale(1)
utility is used to determine whether the system supports the selected
locale.
If it does not,
.B \*n
will exit with an error and report the output of
.BR locale .
.PP
.B Note: \*n
may produce unexpected results if the current locale is set to one in which
the KOI8-R character encoding is not supported, or if fonts using that
encoding are not available.
In the Debian system, the \*(``xfonts\-cyrillic\*('' package provides the
fonts that
.B \*n
uses by default.
To change the fonts
.B \*n
uses, edit the
.I __apploaddir__/KOI8R__default_class__
file.
.PP
A similar wrapper,
.B uxterm(1),
is available for Unicode UTF-8 environments.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B LC_ALL\fR, \fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLANG
The values of these variables are checked, in order, to determine the
character set used by the current locale.
.SH AUTHOR
.B \*n
was written by Branden Robinson and is very heavily based on
.BR uxterm ,
by Thomas Dickey.
The assistance of Jurij Smakov was invaluable in sanity-checking its
operation.
