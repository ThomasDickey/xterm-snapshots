Comment:
 SPDX refers to this as "X11": https://spdx.org/licenses/X11.html
 .
 Debian refers to this as MIT or MIT-X11 and then confuses it with Expat.
 Expat is not the same as MIT-X11.  MIT-X11 appeared in X11R6 (1995).
 Expat first appeared a few years later (1998), copying MIT-X11 but omitting
 the last paragraph.
