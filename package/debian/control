Description: X terminal emulator (development version)
 xterm is the standard terminal emulator for the X Window System.
 It provides DEC VT102 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for
 programs that cannot use the window system directly.  This version
 implements ISO/ANSI colors, Unicode, and most of the control sequences
 used by DEC VT220 terminals.
 .
 This package contains a development version of xterm.  It is
 configured to use "xterm-dev" and "XTermDev" for the program
 and its resource class, to avoid conflict with other packages.
