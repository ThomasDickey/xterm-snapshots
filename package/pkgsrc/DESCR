The xterm program is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides
DEC VT102 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that can't use
the window system directly.

This version implements ISO/ANSI colors using the "new" color model
(i.e., background color erase). It also implements most of the control
sequences for VT220.
