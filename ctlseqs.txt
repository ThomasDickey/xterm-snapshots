Definitions

c    The literal character c.

C    A single (required) character.

Ps   A single (usually optional) numeric parameter, composed of one of
     more digits.

Pm   A multiple numeric parameter composed of any number of single
     numeric parameters, separated by ;  character(s).  Individual val-
     ues for the parameters are listed with Ps .

Pt   A text parameter composed of printable characters.

C1 (8-Bit) Control Characters

The xterm program recognizes both 8-bit and 7-bit control characters.
It generates 7-bit controls (by default) or 8-bit if S8C1T is enabled.
The following pairs of 7-bit and 8-bit control characters are equiva-
lent:

ESC D
     Index (IND  is 0x84).
ESC E
     Next Line (NEL  is 0x85).
ESC H
     Tab Set (HTS  is 0x88).
ESC M
     Reverse Index (RI  is 0x8d).
ESC N
     Single Shift Select of G2 Character Set (SS2  is 0x8e).  This
     affects next character only.
ESC O
     Single Shift Select of G3 Character Set (SS3  is 0x8f).  This
     affects next character only.
ESC P
     Device Control String (DCS  is 0x90).
ESC V
     Start of Guarded Area (SPA  is 0x96).
ESC W
     End of Guarded Area (EPA  is 0x97).
ESC X
     Start of String (SOS  is 0x98).
ESC Z
     Return Terminal ID (DECID is 0x9a).  Obsolete form of CSI c  (DA).
ESC [
     Control Sequence Introducer (CSI  is 0x9b).
ESC \
     String Terminator (ST  is 0x9c).
ESC ]
     Operating System Command (OSC  is 0x9d).
ESC ^
     Privacy Message (PM  is 0x9e).
ESC _
     Application Program Command (APC  is 0x9f).

These control characters are used in the vtXXX emulation.

VT100 Mode
Most of these control sequences are standard VT102 control sequences,
but there is support for later DEC VT terminals (i.e., VT220, VT320,
VT420, VT510), as well as ISO 6429 and aixterm color controls.  The only
VT102 feature not supported is auto-repeat, since the only way X pro-
vides for this will affect all windows.  There are additional control
sequences to provide xterm-dependent functions, such as the scrollbar or
window size.  Where the function is specified by DEC or ISO 6429, the
code assigned to it is given in parentheses.  The escape codes to desig-
nate and invoke character sets are specified by ISO 2022; see that docu-
ment for a discussion of character sets.

Single-character functions
BEL       Bell (Ctrl-G).
BS        Backspace (Ctrl-H).
CR        Carriage Return (Ctrl-M).
ENQ       Return Terminal Status (Ctrl-E).  Default response is an empty
          string, but may be overridden by a resource answerbackString.
FF        Form Feed or New Page (NP).  Ctrl-L is treated the same as LF.
LF        Line Feed or New Line (NL).  (LF is Ctrl-J).
SI        Shift In (Ctrl-O) -> Switch to Standard Character Set.  This
          invokes the G0 character set (the default).
SO        Shift Out (Ctrl-N) -> Switch to Alternate Character Set.  This
          invokes the G1 character set.
SP        Space.
TAB       Horizontal Tab (HT) (Ctrl-I).
VT        Vertical Tab (Ctrl-K).  This is treated the same as LF.

ESC % G   Select UTF-8 character set (ISO 2022).
ESC ( C   Designate G0 Character Set (ISO 2022, VT100).
          Final character C for designating 94-character sets.  In this
          list, 0 , A  and B  apply to VT100 and up, the remainder to
          VT220 and up:
            C = 0  -> DEC Special Character and Line Drawing Set.
            C = A  -> United Kingdom (UK).
            C = B  -> United States (USASCII).

Application Program-Control functions
APC Pt ST None.  xterm implements no APC  functions; Pt is ignored.  Pt
          need not be printable characters.

Device-Control functions
DCS Ps; Ps| Pt ST
          User-Defined Keys (DECUDK).  The first parameter:
            Ps = 0  -> Clear all UDK definitions before starting
          (default).
            Ps = 1  -> Erase Below (default).
          The second parameter:
            Ps = 0  <- Lock the keys (default).
            Ps = 1  <- Do not lock.
          The third parameter is a ';'-separated list of strings denot-
          ing the key-code separated by a '/' from the hex-encoded key
          value.  The key codes correspond to the DEC function-key codes
          (e.g., F6=17).
DCS $ q Pt ST
          Request Status String (DECRQSS).  The string following the "q"
          is one of the following:
            " q     -> DECSCA
            " p     -> DECSCL
            r       -> DECSTBM
            m       -> SGR
            SP q    -> DECSCUSR
          xterm responds with DCS 1 $ r Pt ST for valid requests,
          replacing the Pt with the corresponding CSI string, or DCS 0 $
          r Pt ST for invalid requests.
DCS + p Pt ST
          Set Termcap/Terminfo Data (xterm, experimental).  The string
          following the "p" is a name to use for retrieving data from
          the terminal database.  The data will be used for the "tcap"
          keyboard configuration's function- and special-keys, as well
          as by the Request Termcap/Terminfo String control.
DCS + q Pt ST
          Request Termcap/Terminfo String (xterm, experimental).  The
          string following the "q" is a list of names encoded in hexa-
          decimal (2 digits per character) separated by ; which corre-
          spond to termcap or terminfo key names.
          Two special features are also recognized, which are not key
          names: Co for termcap colors (or colors for terminfo colors),
          and TN for termcap name (or name for terminfo name).
          xterm responds with DCS 1 + r Pt ST for valid requests, adding
          to Pt an = , and the value of the corresponding string that
          xterm would send, or DCS 0 + r Pt ST for invalid requests.
          The strings are encoded in hexadecimal (2 digits per charac-
          ter).

          Tracking.
CSI > Ps; Ps T
          Reset one or more features of the title modes to the default
          value.  Normally, "reset" disables the feature.  It is possi-
          ble to disable the ability to reset features by compiling a
          different default for the title modes into xterm.
            Ps = 0  -> Do not set window/icon labels using hexadecimal.
            Ps = 1  -> Do not query window/icon labels using hexadeci-
          mal.

          (HPR).
CSI Ps b  Repeat the preceding graphic character Ps times (REP).
CSI Ps c  Send Device Attributes (Primary DA).
            Ps = 0  or omitted -> request attributes from terminal.  The
          response depends on the decTerminalID resource setting.
            -> CSI ? 1 ; 2 c  (``VT100 with Advanced Video Option'')
            -> CSI ? 1 ; 0 c  (``VT101 with No Options'')

            -> CSI ? 6 0 ; 1 ; 2 ; 6 ; 8 ; 9 ; 1 5 ; c  (``VT220'')
          The VT100-style response parameters do not mean anything by
          themselves.  VT220 parameters do, telling the host what fea-
          tures the terminal supports:
            Ps = 1  -> 132-columns.
            Ps = 2  -> Printer.
            Ps = 6  -> Selective erase.
            Ps = 8  -> User-defined keys.
            Ps = 9  -> National replacement character sets.
            Ps = 1 5  -> Technical characters.
            Ps = 1 8  -> User windows.
            Ps = 2 1  -> Horizontal scrolling.
            Ps = 2 2  -> ANSI color, e.g., VT525.
            Ps = 2 9  -> ANSI text locator (i.e., DEC Locator mode).
CSI > Ps c
          Send Device Attributes (Secondary DA).
            Ps = 0  or omitted -> request the terminal's identification
          code.  The response depends on the decTerminalID resource set-
          ting.  It should apply only to VT220 and up, but xterm extends
          this to VT100.
            -> CSI  > Pp ; Pv ; Pc c
          where Pp denotes the terminal type
            Pp = 0  -> ``VT100''.

          and Pv is the firmware version (for xterm, this was originally
          the XFree86 patch number, starting with 95).  In a DEC termi-
          nal, Pc indicates the ROM cartridge registration number and is
          always zero.

            Ps = 3 4  -> Set foreground color to Blue.
            Ps = 3 5  -> Set foreground color to Magenta.
            Ps = 3 6  -> Set foreground color to Cyan.
            Ps = 3 7  -> Set foreground color to White.
            Ps = 3 9  -> Set foreground color to default (original).
            Ps = 4 0  -> Set background color to Black.
            Ps = 4 1  -> Set background color to Red.

            Ps = 4 6  -> Set background color to Cyan.
            Ps = 4 7  -> Set background color to White.
            Ps = 4 9  -> Set background color to default (original).

          If 16-color support is compiled, the following apply.  Assume
          that xterm's resources are set so that the ISO color codes are
          the first 8 of a set of 16.  Then the aixterm colors are the
          bright versions of the ISO colors:
            Ps = 9 0  -> Set foreground color to Black.
            Ps = 9 1  -> Set foreground color to Red.
            Ps = 9 2  -> Set foreground color to Green.
            Ps = 9 3  -> Set foreground color to Yellow.
            Ps = 9 4  -> Set foreground color to Blue.
            Ps = 9 5  -> Set foreground color to Magenta.
            Ps = 9 6  -> Set foreground color to Cyan.
            Ps = 9 7  -> Set foreground color to White.
            Ps = 1 0 0  -> Set background color to Black.
            Ps = 1 0 1  -> Set background color to Red.
            Ps = 1 0 2  -> Set background color to Green.
            Ps = 1 0 3  -> Set background color to Yellow.
            Ps = 1 0 4  -> Set background color to Blue.
            Ps = 1 0 5  -> Set background color to Magenta.
            Ps = 1 0 6  -> Set background color to Cyan.
            Ps = 1 0 7  -> Set background color to White.

          If xterm is compiled with the 16-color support disabled, it
          supports the following, from rxvt:
            Ps = 1 0 0  -> Set foreground and background color to
          default.

          Xterm maintains a color palette whose entries are identified
          by an index beginning with zero.  If 88- or 256-color support
          is compiled, the following apply:
          o   All parameters are decimal integers.
          o   RGB values range from zero (0) to 255.
          o   ISO-8613-3 can be interpreted in more than one way; xterm
              allows the semicolons in this control to be replaced by
              colons (but after the first colon, colons must be used).

          These ISO-8613-3 controls are supported:
            Ps = 3 8  ; 2  ; Pr ; Pg ; Pb -> Set foreground color to the
          closest match in xterm's palette for the given RGB Pr/Pg/Pb.
            Ps = 3 8  ; 5  ; Ps -> Set foreground color to the second
          Ps.
            Ps = 4 8  ; 2  ; Pr ; Pg ; Pb -> Set background color to the
          closest match in xterm's palette for the given RGB Pr/Pg/Pb.
            Ps = 4 8  ; 5  ; Ps -> Set background color to the second
          Ps.

CSI > Ps; Ps m
          Set or reset resource-values used by xterm to decide whether
          to construct escape sequences holding information about the
          modifiers pressed with a given key.  The first parameter iden-
          tifies the resource to set/reset.  The second parameter is the
          value to assign to the resource.  If the second parameter is
          omitted, the resource is reset to its initial value.
            Ps = 0  -> modifyKeyboard.
            Ps = 1  -> modifyCursorKeys.
            Ps = 2  -> modifyFunctionKeys.
            Ps = 4  -> modifyOtherKeys.
          If no parameters are given, all resources are reset to their
          initial values.
CSI Ps n  Device Status Report (DSR).
            Ps = 5  -> Status Report.  Result (``OK'') is
          CSI 0 n
            Ps = 6  -> Report Cursor Position (CPR) [row;column].
          Result is
          CSI r ; c R
CSI > Ps n
          Disable modifiers which may be enabled via the CSI > Ps; Ps m
          sequence.  This corresponds to a resource value of "-1", which
          cannot be set with the other sequence.  The parameter identi-
          fies the resource to be disabled:
            Ps = 0  -> modifyKeyboard.
            Ps = 1  -> modifyCursorKeys.
            Ps = 2  -> modifyFunctionKeys.
            Ps = 4  -> modifyOtherKeys.
          If the parameter is omitted, modifyFunctionKeys is disabled.
          When modifyFunctionKeys is disabled, xterm uses the modifier
          keys to make an extended sequence of functions rather than
          adding a parameter to each function key to denote the modi-
          fiers.
CSI ? Ps n

          CSI ? 2 7 ; 1 ; 0 ; 0 n  (North American).
          The last two parameters apply to VT400 & up, and denote key-
          board ready and LK01 respectively.
            Ps = 5 3  -> Report Locator status as CSI ? 5 3 n  Locator

              The x's are hexadecimal digits 0-9 and A-F.
            Ps = 7 5  -> Report data integrity as CSI ? 7 0 n  (ready,
          no errors)

          Parameters are [top;left;bottom;right].
          Defines the coordinates of a filter rectangle and activates
          it.  Anytime the locator is detected outside of the filter
          rectangle, an outside rectangle event is generated and the
          rectangle is disabled.  Filter rectangles are always treated
          as "one-shot" events.  Any parameters that are omitted default
          to the current locator position.  If all parameters are omit-
          ted, any locator motion will be reported.  DECELR always can-
          cels any prevous rectangle definition.
CSI Ps x  Request Terminal Parameters (DECREQTPARM).
          if Ps is a "0" (default) or "1", and xterm is emulating VT100,
          the control sequence elicits a response of the same form whose
          parameters describe the terminal:
            Ps -> the given Ps incremented by 2.
            Pn = 1  <- no parity.
            Pn = 1  <- eight bits.

            Ps = 1  -> from start to end position, wrapped.
            Ps = 2  -> rectangle (exact).
CSI Pi ; Pg ; Pt; Pl; Pb; Pr * y
          Request Checksum of Rectangular Area (DECRQCRA), VT420 and up.
          Response is
          DCS Pt ! x x x x ST
            Pi is the request id.
            Pg is the page number.
            Pt; Pl; Pb; Pr denotes the rectangle.
            The x's are hexadecimal digits 0-9 and A-F.
CSI Pc ; Pt ; Pl ; Pb ; Pr $ x
          Fill Rectangular Area (DECFRA), VT420 and up.
            Pc is the character to use.
            Pt; Pl; Pb; Pr denotes the rectangle.
CSI Ps ; Pu ' z
          Enable Locator Reporting (DECELR).
          Valid values for the first parameter:
            Ps = 0  -> Locator disabled (default).
            Ps = 1  -> Locator enabled.
            Ps = 2  -> Locator enabled for one report, then disabled.
          The second parameter specifies the coordinate unit for locator
          reports.
          Valid values for the second parameter:
            Pu = 0  <- or omitted -> default to character cells.
            Pu = 1  <- device physical pixels.
            Pu = 2  <- character cells.
CSI Pt; Pl; Pb; Pr$ z
          Erase Rectangular Area (DECERA), VT400 and up.
            Pt; Pl; Pb; Pr denotes the rectangle.
CSI Pm ' {
          Select Locator Events (DECSLE).
          Valid values for the first (and any additional parameters)
          are:
            Ps = 0  -> only respond to explicit host requests (DECRQLP).
                       (This is default).  It also cancels any filter
                       rectangle.
            Ps = 1  -> report button down transitions.
            Ps = 2  -> do not report button down transitions.
            Ps = 3  -> report button up transitions.
            Ps = 4  -> do not report button up transitions.
CSI Pt; Pl; Pb; Pr $ {
          Selective Erase Rectangular Area (DECSERA), VT400 and up.
            Pt; Pl; Pb; Pr denotes the rectangle.
CSI Ps ' |
          Request Locator Position (DECRQLP).
          Valid values for the parameter are:
            Ps = 0 , 1 or omitted -> transmit a single DECLRP locator
          report.

          If Locator Reporting has been enabled by a DECELR, xterm will
          respond with a DECLRP Locator Report.  This report is also
          generated on button up and down events if they have been
          enabled with a DECSLE, or when the locator is detected outside
          of a filter rectangle, if filter rectangles have been enabled
          with a DECEFR.

            -> CSI Pe ; Pb ; Pr ; Pc ; Pp &  w

          Parameters are [event;button;row;column;page].
          Valid values for the event:
            Pe = 0  -> locator unavailable - no other parameters sent.
            Pe = 1  -> request - xterm received a DECRQLP.
            Pe = 2  -> left button down.
            Pe = 3  -> left button up.
            Pe = 4  -> middle button down.
            Pe = 5  -> middle button up.
            Pe = 6  -> right button down.
            Pe = 7  -> right button up.
            Pe = 8  -> M4 button down.
            Pe = 9  -> M4 button up.
            Pe = 1 0  -> locator outside filter rectangle.
          ``button'' parameter is a bitmask indicating which buttons are
          pressed:
            Pb = 0  <- no buttons down.
            Pb & 1  <- right button down.
            Pb & 2  <- middle button down.
            Pb & 4  <- left button down.
            Pb & 8  <- M4 button down.
          ``row'' and ``column'' parameters are the coordinates of the
          locator position in the xterm window, encoded as ASCII deci-
          mal.
          The ``page'' parameter is not used by xterm, and will be omit-
          ted.
CSI Pm SP }
          Insert Ps Column(s) (default = 1) (DECIC), VT420 and up.
CSI Pm SP ~
          Delete Ps Column(s) (default = 1) (DECDC), VT420 and up.

Operating System Controls
OSC Ps ; Pt ST
OSC Ps ; Pt BEL
          Set Text Parameters.  For colors and font, if Pt is a "?", the
          control sequence elicits a response which consists of the con-
          trol sequence which would set the corresponding value.  The
          dtterm control sequences allow you to determine the icon name
          and window title.
            Ps = 0  -> Change Icon Name and Window Title to Pt.
            Ps = 1  -> Change Icon Name to Pt.
            Ps = 2  -> Change Window Title to Pt.
            Ps = 3  -> Set X property on top-level window.  Pt should be
          in the form "prop=value", or just "prop" to delete the prop-
          erty
            Ps = 4  ; c ; spec -> Change Color Number c to the color
          specified by spec.  This can be a name or RGB specification as
          per XParseColor.  Any number of c name pairs may be given.
          The color numbers correspond to the ANSI colors 0-7, their
          bright versions 8-15, and if supported, the remainder of the
          88-color or 256-color table.

          If a "?" is given rather than a name or RGB specification,
          xterm replies with a control sequence of the same form which
          can be used to set the corresponding color.  Because more than
          one pair of color number and specification can be given in one
          control sequence, xterm can make more than one reply.

            Ps = 5  ; c ; spec -> Change Special Color Number c to the
          color specified by spec.  This can be a name or RGB specifica-
          tion as per XParseColor.  Any number of c name pairs may be
          given.  The special colors can also be set by adding the maxi-
          mum number of colors to these codes in an OSC 4  control:

            Pc = 0  <- resource colorBD (BOLD).
            Pc = 1  <- resource colorUL (UNDERLINE).
            Pc = 2  <- resource colorBL (BLINK).
            Pc = 3  <- resource colorRV (REVERSE).

          The 10 colors (below) which may be set or queried using 1 0
          through 1 9  are denoted dynamic colors, since the correspond-
          ing control sequences were the first means for setting xterm's
          colors dynamically, i.e., after it was started.  They are not
          the same as the ANSI colors.  These controls may be disabled
          using the allowColorOps resource.  At least one parameter is
          expected for Pt.  Each successive parameter changes the next
          color in the list.  The value of Ps tells the starting point
          in the list.  The colors are specified by name or RGB specifi-
          cation as per XParseColor.

          If a "?" is given rather than a name or RGB specification,
          xterm replies with a control sequence of the same form which
          can be used to set the corresponding dynamic color.  Because
          more than one pair of color number and specification can be
          given in one control sequence, xterm can make more than one
          reply.

            Ps = 1 0  -> Change VT100 text foreground color to Pt.
            Ps = 1 1  -> Change VT100 text background color to Pt.
            Ps = 1 2  -> Change text cursor color to Pt.
            Ps = 1 3  -> Change mouse foreground color to Pt.
            Ps = 1 4  -> Change mouse background color to Pt.
            Ps = 1 5  -> Change Tektronix foreground color to Pt.
            Ps = 1 6  -> Change Tektronix background color to Pt.
            Ps = 1 7  -> Change highlight background color to Pt.
            Ps = 1 8  -> Change Tektronix cursor color to Pt.
            Ps = 1 9  -> Change highlight foreground color to Pt.

            Ps = 4 6  -> Change Log File to Pt.  (This is normally dis-
          abled by a compile-time option).

            Ps = 5 0  -> Set Font to Pt.  These controls may be disabled
          using the allowFontOps resource.  If Pt begins with a "#",
          index in the font menu, relative (if the next character is a
          plus or minus sign) or absolute.  A number is expected but not
          required after the sign (the default is the current entry for
          relative, zero for absolute indexing).
          The same rule (plus or minus sign, optional number) is used
          when querying the font.  The remainder of Pt is ignored.
          A font can be specified after a "#" index expression, by
          adding a space and then the font specifier.
          If the "TrueType Fonts" menu entry is set (the renderFont
          resource), then this control sets/queries the faceName
          resource.

            Ps = 5 1  (reserved for Emacs shell).

            Ps = 5 2  -> Manipulate Selection Data.  These controls may
          be disabled using the allowWindowOps resource.  The parameter
          Pt is parsed as
               Pc; Pd
          The first, Pc, may contain zero or more characters from the
          set c  p  s  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 .  It is used to construct
          a list of selection parameters for clipboard, primary, select,
          or cut buffers 0 through 7 respectively, in the order given.
          If the parameter is empty, xterm uses s 0 , to specify the
          configurable primary/clipboard selection and cut buffer 0.
          The second parameter, Pd, gives the selection data.  Normally
          this is a string encoded in base64.  The data becomes the new
          selection, which is then available for pasting by other appli-
          cations.
          If the second parameter is a ? , xterm replies to the host
          with the selection data encoded using the same protocol.
          If the second parameter is neither a base64 string nor ? ,
          then the selection is cleared.

            Ps = 1 0 4  ; c -> Reset Color Number c.  It is reset to the
          color specified by the corresponding X resource.  Any number
          of c parameters may be given.  These parameters correspond to
          the ANSI colors 0-7, their bright versions 8-15, and if sup-
          ported, the remainder of the 88-color or 256-color table.  If
          no parameters are given, the entire table will be reset.

            Ps = 1 0 5  ; c -> Reset Special Color Number c.  It is
          reset to the color specified by the corresponding X resource.
          Any number of c parameters may be given.  These parameters
          correspond to the special colors which can be set using an OSC
          5  control (or by adding the maximum number of colors using an
          OSC 4  control).

          The dynamic colors can also be reset to their default
          (resource) values:
            Ps = 1 1 0  -> Reset VT100 text foreground color.
            Ps = 1 1 1  -> Reset VT100 text background color.
            Ps = 1 1 2  -> Reset text cursor color.
            Ps = 1 1 3  -> Reset mouse foreground color.
            Ps = 1 1 4  -> Reset mouse background color.
            Ps = 1 1 5  -> Reset Tektronix foreground color.
            Ps = 1 1 6  -> Reset Tektronix background color.
            Ps = 1 1 7  -> Reset highlight color.
            Ps = 1 1 8  -> Reset Tektronix cursor color.

PM Pt ST  xterm implements no PM  functions; Pt is ignored.  Pt need not
          be printable characters.

Alt and Meta Keys
Many keyboards have keys labeled "Alt".  Few have keys labeled "Meta".
However, xterm's default translations use the Meta modifier.  Common
keyboard configurations assign the Meta modifier to an "Alt" key.  By
using xmodmap one may have the modifier assigned to a different key, and
have "real" alt and meta keys.  Here is an example:

             ! put meta on mod3 to distinguish it from alt
             keycode 64 = Alt_L
             clear mod1
             add mod1 = Alt_L
             keycode 115 = Meta_L
             clear mod3
             add mod3 = Meta_L


The metaSendsEscape resource (and altSendsEscape if altIsNotMeta is set)
can be used to control the way the Meta modifier applies to ordinary
keys unless the modifyOtherKeys resource is set:
          - prefix a key with the ESC  character.
          - shift the key from codes 0-127 to 128-255 by adding 128.

The table shows the result for a given character "x" with modifiers
according to the default translations with the resources set on or off.
This assumes altIsNotMeta is set:

       key          altSendsEscape   metaSendsEscape   result

PC-Style Function Keys
If xterm does minimal translation of the function keys, it usually does
this with a PC-style keyboard, so PC-style function keys result.  Sun
keyboards are similar to PC keyboards.  Both have cursor and scrolling
operations printed on the keypad, which duplicate the smaller cursor and
scrolling keypads.

X does not predefine NumLock (used for VT220 keyboards) or Alt (used as
an extension for the Sun/PC keyboards) as modifiers.  These keys are
recognized as modifiers when enabled by the numLock resource, or by the
"DECSET 1 0 3 5 " control sequence.

The cursor keys transmit the following escape sequences depending on the
mode specified via the DECCKM escape sequence.

                      Key         Normal    Application
                  --------------------------------------
                  Cursor Up      CSI A      SS3 A
                  Cursor Down    CSI B      SS3 B
                  Cursor Right   CSI C      SS3 C
                  Cursor Left    CSI D      SS3 D
                  --------------------------------------

The home- and end-keys (unlike PageUp and other keys also on the 6-key
editing keypad) are considered "cursor keys" by xterm.  Their mode is
also controlled by the DECCKM escape sequence:

                      Key       Normal    Application
                    ----------------------------------
                    Home       CSI H      SS3 H
                    End        CSI F      SS3 F
                    ----------------------------------


The application keypad transmits the following escape sequences depend-
ing on the mode specified via the DECKPNM and DECKPAM escape sequences.
Use the NumLock key to override the application mode.

Not all keys are present on the Sun/PC keypad (e.g., PF1, Tab), but are
supported by the program.

They also provide 12 function keys, as well as a few other special-pur-
pose keys:

                       ---------------------------


Older versions of xterm implement different escape sequences for F1
through F4.  These can be activated by setting the oldXtermFKeys
resource.  However, since they do not correspond to any hardware termi-
nal, they have been deprecated.  (The DEC VT220 reserves F1 through F5
for local functions such as Setup).

                         Key      Escape Sequence
                       ---------------------------
                       F1         CSI 1 1 ~
                       F2         CSI 1 2 ~

                       ---------------------------

In normal mode, i.e., a Sun/PC keyboard when the sunKeyboard resource is
false, xterm recognizes function key modifiers which are parameters
appended before the final character of the control sequence.

                      Code     Modifiers
                    ---------------------------------
                       2       Shift
                       3       Alt
                       4       Shift + Alt
                       5       Control
                       6       Shift + Control
                       7       Alt + Control
                       8       Shift + Alt + Control
                    ---------------------------------

For example, shift-F5 would be sent as CSI 1 5 ; 2 ~

If the alwaysUseMods resource is set, the Meta modifier also is recog-
nized, making parameters 9 through 16.

VT220-Style Function Keys
However, xterm is most useful as a DEC VT102 or VT220 emulator.  Set the
sunKeyboard resource to true to force a Sun/PC keyboard to act like a
VT220 keyboard.

The VT102/VT220 application keypad transmits unique escape sequences in
application mode, which are distinct from the cursor and scrolling key-
pad:

                  --------------------------------------

The VT220 provides a 6-key editing keypad, which is analogous to that on
the PC keyboard.  It is not affected by DECCKM or DECKPNM/DECKPAM:

                     Key       Normal    Application
                   ----------------------------------
                   Insert     CSI 2 ~    CSI 2 ~
                   Delete     CSI 3 ~    CSI 3 ~
                   Home       CSI 1 ~    CSI 1 ~
                   End        CSI 4 ~    CSI 4 ~
                   PageUp     CSI 5 ~    CSI 5 ~
                   PageDown   CSI 6 ~    CSI 6 ~
                   ----------------------------------

The VT220 provides 8 additional function keys.  With a Sun/PC keyboard,
access these keys by Control/F1 for F13, etc.

                       ---------------------------


VT52-Style Function Keys
A VT52 does not have function keys, but it does have a numeric keypad
and cursor keys.  They differ from the other emulations by the prefix.
Also, the cursor keys do not change:

                       Key        Normal/Application
                   ----------------------------------
                   Cursor Up      ESC A
                   Cursor Down    ESC B
                   Cursor Right   ESC C
                   Cursor Left    ESC D
                   ----------------------------------

The keypad is similar:

Sun-Style Function Keys
The xterm program provides support for Sun keyboards more directly, by a
menu toggle that causes it to send Sun-style function key codes rather
than VT220.  Note, however, that the sun and VT100 emulations are not
really compatible.  For example, their wrap-margin behavior differs.

Only function keys are altered; keypad and cursor keys are the same.
The emulation responds identically.  See the xterm-sun terminfo entry
for details.

HP-Style Function Keys
Similarly, xterm can be compiled to support HP keyboards.  See the
xterm-hp terminfo entry for details.

The Alternate Screen Buffer
Xterm maintains two screen buffers.  The normal screen buffer allows you
to scroll back to view saved lines of output up to the maximum set by
the saveLines resource.  The alternate screen buffer is exactly as large
as the display, contains no additional saved lines.  When the alternate
screen buffer is active, you cannot scroll back to view saved lines.
Xterm provides control sequences and menu entries for switching between
the two.

Most full-screen applications use terminfo or termcap to obtain strings
used to start/stop full-screen mode, i.e., smcup and rmcup for terminfo,
or the corresponding ti and te for termcap.  The titeInhibit resource
removes the ti and te strings from the TERMCAP string which is set in
the environment for some platforms.  That is not done when xterm is
built with terminfo libraries because terminfo does not provide the
whole text of the termcap data in one piece.  It would not work for ter-
minfo anyway, since terminfo data is not passed in environment vari-
ables; setting an environment variable in this manner would have no
effect on the application's ability to switch between normal and alter-
nate screen buffers.  Instead, the newer private mode controls (such as
1 0 4 9 ) for switching between normal and alternate screen buffers sim-
ply disable the switching.  They add other features such as clearing the
display for the same reason: to make the details of switching indepen-
dent of the application that requests the switch.

Bracketed Paste Mode
When bracketed paste mode is set, pasted text is bracketed with control
sequences so that the program can differentiate pasted text from typed-
in text.  When bracketed paste mode is set, the program will receive:
   ESC  [ 200 ~,
followed by the pasted text, followed by
   ESC  [ 201 ~.

Title Modes
The window- and icon-labels can be set or queried using control
sequences.  As a VT220-emulator, xterm "should" limit the character
encoding for the corresponding strings to ISO-8859-1.  Indeed, it used
to be the case (and was documented) that window titles had to be
ISO-8859-1.  This is no longer the case.  However, there are many appli-
cations which still assume that titles are set using ISO-8859-1.  So
that is the default behavior.

If xterm is running with UTF-8 encoding, it is possible to use window-
and icon-labels encoded using UTF-8.  That is because the underlying X
libraries (and many, but not all) window managers support this feature.

The utf8Title X resource setting tells xterm to disable a reconversion
of the title string back to ISO-8859-1, allowing the title strings to be
interpreted as UTF-8.  The same feature can be enabled using the title
mode control sequence described in this summary.

Separate from the ability to set the titles, xterm provides the ability
to query the titles, returning them either in ISO-8859-1 or UTF-8.  This
choice is available only while xterm is using UTF-8 encoding.

Finally, the characters sent to, or returned by a title control are less
constrained than the rest of the control sequences.  To make them more
manageable (and constrained), for use in shell scripts, xterm has an
optional feature which decodes the string from hexadecimal (for setting
titles) or for encoding the title into hexadecimal when querying the
value.

Mouse Tracking
The VT widget can be set to send the mouse position and other informa-
tion on button presses.  These modes are typically used by editors and
other full-screen applications that want to make use of the mouse.

There are two sets of mutually exclusive modes:
o   mouse protocol
o   protocol encoding

The mouse protocols include DEC Locator mode, enabled by the DECELR CSI
Ps ; Ps  '  z control sequence, and is not described here (control
sequences are summarized above).  The remaining five modes of the mouse
protocols are each enabled (or disabled) by a different parameter in the
"DECSET CSI ? Pm h " or "DECRST CSI ? Pm l " control sequence.

The motion reporting modes are strictly xterm extensions, and are not
part of any standard, though they are analogous to the DEC VT200 DECELR
locator reports.

Normally, parameters (such as pointer position and button number) for
all mouse tracking escape sequences generated by xterm encode numeric
parameters in a single character as value+32.  For example, !  specifies
the value 1.  The upper left character position on the terminal is
denoted as 1,1.  This scheme dates back to X10, though the normal mouse-
tracking (from X11) is more elaborate.

X10 compatibility mode sends an escape sequence only on button press,
encoding the location and the mouse button pressed.  It is enabled by
specifying parameter 9 to DECSET.  On button press, xterm sends CSI M
CbCxCy (6 characters).
o   Cb is button-1.
o   Cx and Cy are the x and y coordinates of the mouse when the button
    was pressed.

Normal tracking mode sends an escape sequence on both button press and
release.  Modifier key (shift, ctrl, meta) information is also sent.  It
is enabled by specifying parameter 1000 to DECSET.  On button press or
release, xterm sends CSI M CbCxCy.
o   The low two bits of Cb encode button information: 0=MB1 pressed,
    1=MB2 pressed, 2=MB3 pressed, 3=release.
o   The next three bits encode the modifiers which were down when the
    button was pressed and are added together:  4=Shift, 8=Meta, 16=Con-
    trol.  Note however that the shift and control bits are normally
    unavailable because xterm uses the control modifier with mouse for
    popup menus, and the shift modifier is used in the default transla-
    tions for button events.  The Meta modifier recognized by xterm is
    the mod1 mask, and is not necessarily the "Meta" key (see xmodmap).
o   Cx and Cy are the x and y coordinates of the mouse event, encoded as
    in X10 mode.

Wheel mice may return buttons 4 and 5.  Those buttons are represented by
the same event codes as buttons 1 and 2 respectively, except that 64 is
added to the event code.  Release events for the wheel buttons are not
reported.  By default, the wheel mouse events are translated to scroll-
back and scroll-forw actions.  Those actions normally scroll the whole
window, as if the scrollbar was used.  However if Alternate Scroll mode
is set, then cursor up/down controls are sent when the terminal is dis-
playing the alternate screen.  The initial state of Alternate Scroll
mode is set using the alternateScroll resource.

Mouse highlight tracking notifies a program of a button press, receives
a range of lines from the program, highlights the region covered by the
mouse within that range until button release, and then sends the program
the release coordinates.  It is enabled by specifying parameter 1001 to
DECSET.  Highlighting is performed only for button 1, though other but-
ton events can be received.

Warning: use of this mode requires a cooperating program or it will hang
xterm.

On button press, the same information as for normal tracking is gener-
ated; xterm then waits for the program to send mouse tracking informa-
tion.  All X events are ignored until the proper escape sequence is
received from the pty: CSI Ps ; Ps ; Ps ; Ps ; Ps T .  The parameters
are func, startx, starty, firstrow, and lastrow.  func is non-zero to
initiate highlight tracking and zero to abort.  startx and starty give
the starting x and y location for the highlighted region.  The ending
location tracks the mouse, but will never be above row firstrow and will
always be above row lastrow.  (The top of the screen is row 1.)  When
the button is released, xterm reports the ending position one of two
ways:
o   if the start and end coordinates are the same locations:
    CSI t CxCy.
o   otherwise:
    CSI T CxCyCxCyCxCy.
    The parameters are startx, starty, endx, endy, mousex, and mousey.
    -    startx, starty, endx, and endy give the starting and ending
         character positions of the region.
    -    mousex and mousey give the location of the mouse at button up,
         which may not be over a character.

Button-event tracking is essentially the same as normal tracking, but
xterm also reports button-motion events.  Motion events are reported
only if the mouse pointer has moved to a different character cell.  It
is enabled by specifying parameter 1002 to DECSET.  On button press or
release, xterm sends the same codes used by normal tracking mode.
o   On button-motion events, xterm adds 32 to the event code (the third
    character, Cb).
o   The other bits of the event code specify button and modifier keys as
    in normal mode.  For example, motion into cell x,y with button 1
    down is reported as CSI M @ CxCy.  ( @  = 32 + 0 (button 1) + 32
    (motion indicator) ).  Similarly, motion with button 3 down is
    reported as CSI M B CxCy.  ( B  = 32 + 2 (button 3) + 32 (motion
    indicator) ).

Any-event mode is the same as button-event mode, except that all motion
events are reported, even if no mouse button is down.  It is enabled by
specifying 1003 to DECSET.

FocusIn/FocusOut can be combined with any of the mouse events since it
uses a different protocol.  When set, it causes xterm to send CSI I
when the terminal gains focus, and CSI O  when it loses focus.

The original X10 mouse protocol limits the Cx and Cy ordinates to 223
(=255 - 32).  Xterm supports more than one scheme for extending this
range, by changing the protocol encoding:
UTF-8 (1005)
          This enables UTF-8 encoding for Cx and Cy under all tracking
          modes, expanding the maximum encodable position from 223 to
          2015.  For positions less than 95, the resulting output is
          identical under both modes.  Under extended mouse mode, posi-
          tions greater than 95 generate "extra" bytes which will con-
          fuse applications which do not treat their input as a UTF-8
          stream.  Likewise, Cb will be UTF-8 encoded, to reduce confu-
          sion with wheel mouse events.
          Under normal mouse mode, positions outside (160,94) result in
          byte pairs which can be interpreted as a single UTF-8 charac-
          ter; applications which do treat their input as UTF-8 will
          almost certainly be confused unless extended mouse mode is
          active.
          This scheme has the drawback that the encoded coordinates will
          not pass through luit unchanged, e.g., for locales using non-
          UTF-8 encoding.
SGR (1006)
          The normal mouse response is altered to use CSI < followed by
          semicolon-separated encoded button value, the Cx and Cy ordi-
          nates and a final character which is M  for button press and m
          for button release.
          The encoded button value in this case does not add 32 since
          that was useful only in the X10 scheme for ensuring that the
          byte containing the button value is a printable code.  The
          modifiers are encoded in the same way.  A different final
          character is used for button release to resolve the X10 ambi-
          guity regarding which button was released.
          The highlight tracking responses are also modified to an SGR-
          like format, using the same SGR-style scheme and button-encod-
          ings.
URXVT (1015)
          The normal mouse response is altered to use CSI followed by
          semicolon-separated encoded button value, the Cx and Cy ordi-
          nates and final character M .
          This uses the same button encoding as X10, but printing it as
          a decimal integer rather than as a single byte.
          However, CSI M  can be mistaken for DL (delete lines), while
          the highlight tracking CSI T  can be mistaken for SD (scroll
          down), and the Window manipulation controls.  For these rea-
          sons, the 1015 control is not recommended; it is not an
          improvement over 1005.
