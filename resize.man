.SH NAME
resize \- set environment and terminal settings to current xterm window size
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B \*n
[ \fB\-v\fP | \fB\-u\fP | \fB\-c\fP ] [ \fB\-s\fP [ \fIrow col\fP ] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I \*N
prints a shell command for setting the appropriate environment variables
to indicate the current size of \fIxterm\fP window from which the command
is run.
.PP
.I \*N
determines the command through several steps:
.bP
first, it finds the name of the user's shell program.
It uses the \fBSHELL\fP variable if set,
otherwise it uses the user's data from /etc/passwd.
.bP
then it decides whether to use Bourne shell syntax or C-Shell syntax.
It uses a built-in table of known shells,
which can be overridden by the \fB\-u\fP and \fB\-c\fP options.
.bP
then \fI\*n\fP asks the operating system for the terminal settings.
This is the same information which can be manipulated using \fIstty\fP.
.bP
then \fI\*n\fP asks the terminal for its size in characters.
Depending on whether the "\fB\-s\fP option is given,
\fI\*n\fP uses a different escape sequence to ask for this information.
.bP
at this point, \fI\*n\fP attempts to update the terminal settings
to reflect the terminal window's size in pixels:
.RS
.bP
if the \fB\-s\fP option is used,
\fI\*n\fP then asks the terminal for its size in pixels.
.bP
otherwise,
\fI\*n\fP asks the operating system for the information
and updates that after ensuring that the window's dimensions are
a multiple of the character height and width.
.bP
in either case, the updated terminal settings are done
using a different system call than used for \fIstty\fP.
.RE
.bP
then \fI\*n\fP updates the terminal settings to reflect any altered
values such as its size in rows or columns.
This affects the values shown by \fIstty\fP.
.bP
finally, \fI\*n\fP writes the shell command for setting the
environment variables to the standard output.
.SH EXAMPLES
For \*n's output to take effect,
\fI\*n\fP must either be evaluated
as part of the command line (usually done with a shell alias or function) or
else redirected to a file which can then be read in.
From the C shell (usually
known as \fI/bin/csh\fP), the following alias could be defined in the
user's \fI.cshrc\fP:
.sp
.nf
        %  alias rs \*(AQset noglob; eval \fC\`\fP\*n\fC\`\fP\*(AQ
.fi
.sp
After resizing the window, the user would type:
.sp
.nf
        %  rs
.fi
.sp
Users of versions of the Bourne shell (usually known as \fI/bin/sh\fP) that
don't have command
functions will need to send the output to a temporary file and then read it back
in with the \*(``.\*('' command:
.sp
.nf
        $  \*n > /tmp/out
        $  .\0/tmp/out
.fi
.SH OPTIONS
The following options may be used with \fI\*n\fP:
.TP 8
.B \-c
This option indicates that C shell commands should be generated even if the
user's current shell is not \fI/bin/csh\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-s \fR[\fIrows columns\fP]
This option indicates that Sun console escape sequences will be used
instead of the VT100-style \fIxterm\fP escape codes.
If \fIrows\fP and
\fIcolumns\fP are given,
\fI\*n\fP will ask the \fIxterm\fP to resize itself using those values.
.IP
Both of the escape sequences used for this option
(first to obtain the window size and
second to modify it)
are subject to \fIxterm\fP's \fBallowWindowOps\fP resource setting.
The window manager may also choose to disallow the change.
.IP
The VT100-style escape sequence used to determine the
screen size always works for VT100-compatible terminals.
VT100s have no corresponding way to modify the screensize.
.TP 8
.B \-u
This option indicates that Bourne shell commands should be generated even if
the user's current shell is not \fI/bin/sh\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-v
This causes \fI\*n\fP to print a version number to the standard output,
and then exit.
.PP
Note that the Sun console escape sequences are recognized
by XFree86 \fIxterm\fP and
by \fIdtterm\fP.
The \fI\*n\fP program may be installed as \fIsunsize\fP,
which causes makes it assume the \fB\-s\fP option.
.PP
The \fIrows\fP and
\fIcolumns\fP arguments must appear last; though they are normally
associated with the \fB\-s\fP option, they are parsed separately.
.SH FILES
.TP 15
/etc/termcap
for the base termcap entry to modify.
.TP 15
~/.cshrc
user's alias for the command.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP 15
SHELL
.I \*N
determines the user's current shell by first checking if \fB$SHELL\fP
is set, and using that.
Otherwise it determines the user's shell by looking in the password file
(/etc/passwd).
Generally Bourne-shell variants (including \fIksh\fP)
do not modify \fB$SHELL\fP,
so it is possible for \fI\*n\fP to be confused if one runs
\fI\*n\fP from a Bourne shell spawned from a C shell.
.TP 15
TERM
.I \*N
sets this to "__default_termname__" if not already set.
.TP 15
TERMCAP
.I \*N
sets this variable on systems using termcap,
e.g., when \*n is linked with the \fItermcap\fP library
rather than a \fIterminfo\fP library.
The latter does not provide the complete text for a termcap entry.
.TP 15
COLUMNS, LINES
.I \*N
sets these variables on systems using terminfo.
Many applications (including the curses library) 
use those variables when set to override their screensize.
