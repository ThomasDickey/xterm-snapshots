.SH NAME
\*n \- terminal emulator for X
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B \*n
[\-\fItoolkitoption\fP ...] [\-\fIoption\fP ...] [\fIshell\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fI\*n\fP program is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.
It provides DEC VT102/VT220 and selected features from higher-level
terminals such as VT320/VT420/VT520 (VTxxx).
It also provides Tektronix 4014 emulation
for programs that cannot use the window system directly.
If the underlying operating system supports
terminal resizing capabilities (for example, the SIGWINCH signal in systems
derived from 4.3bsd), \fI\*n\fP will use the facilities to notify programs
running in the window whenever it is resized.
.
.PP
The VTxxx and Tektronix 4014 terminals each have their own window so that you
can edit text in one and look at graphics in the other at the same time.
To maintain the correct aspect ratio (height/width), Tektronix graphics will
be restricted to the largest box with a 4014's aspect ratio that will fit in
the window.
This box is located in the upper left area of the window.
.
.PP
Although both windows may be displayed at the same time, one of them is
considered the \*(``active\*('' window for receiving keyboard input and terminal
output.
This is the window that contains the text cursor.
The active window can be chosen through escape sequences,
the \*(``VT Options\*('' menu in the VTxxx window, and the \*(``Tek Options\*(''
menu in the 4014 window.
.
.SH EMULATIONS
The VT102 emulation is fairly complete, but does not support
autorepeat.
Double-size characters are displayed properly if your font server supports
scalable fonts.
The VT220 emulation does not support soft fonts, it is otherwise complete.
.IR Termcap (5)
entries that work with
.I \*n
include
an optional platform-specific entry (\*(``__default_termname__\*(''),
\*(``xterm\*('',
\*(``vt102\*('',
\*(``vt100\*('',
\*(``ansi\*('' and
\*(``dumb\*(''.
.I \*n
automatically searches the termcap file in this order for these entries and then
sets the \*(``TERM\*('' and the \*(``TERMCAP\*('' environment variables.
You may also use \*(``vt220\*('',  but must set the terminal emulation level
with the \fBdecTerminalID\fP resource.
(The \*(``TERMCAP\*('' environment variable is not set if \fI\*n\fP is linked
against a terminfo library, since the requisite information is not provided
by the termcap emulation of terminfo libraries).
.
.PP
Many of the special
.I \*n
features may be modified under program control
through a set of escape sequences different from the standard VT102 escape
sequences.
(See the
.I "Xterm Control Sequences"
document.)
.
.PP
The Tektronix 4014 emulation is also fairly good.
It supports 12-bit graphics addressing, scaled to the window size.
Four different font sizes and five different lines types are supported.
There is no write-through or defocused mode support.
The Tektronix text and graphics commands are recorded internally by
.I \*n
and may be written to a file by sending the COPY escape sequence (or through
the
.B Tektronix
menu; see below).
The name of the file will be
\*(``\fBCOPY\fIyyyy\fB\-\fIMM\fB\-\fIdd\fB.\fIhh\fB:\fImm\fB:\fIss\fR\*('', where
.IR yyyy ,
.IR MM ,
.IR dd ,
.IR hh ,
.I mm
and
.I ss
are the year, month, day, hour, minute and second when the COPY was performed
(the file is created in the directory
.I \*n
is started in, or the home directory for a login
.IR \*n ).
.
.PP
Not all of the features described in this manual are necessarily available in
this version of \fI\*n\fP.
Some (e.g., the non-VT220 extensions) are available
only if they were compiled in, though the most commonly-used are in the
default configuration.
.
.SH "OTHER FEATURES"
.I Xterm
automatically highlights the text cursor when the
pointer enters the window (selected) and unhighlights it when the pointer
leaves the window (unselected).
If the window is the focus window, then the text cursor is
highlighted no matter where the pointer is.
.
.PP
In VT102 mode, there are escape sequences to activate and deactivate
an alternate screen buffer, which is the same size as the display area
of the window.
When activated, the current screen is saved and replaced with the alternate
screen.
Saving of lines scrolled off the top of the window is disabled until the
normal screen is restored.
The
.IR termcap (5)
entry for
.I \*n
allows the visual editor
.IR vi (1)
to switch to the alternate screen for editing and to restore the screen
on exit.
A popup menu entry makes it simple to switch between the normal and
alternate screens for cut and paste.
.
.PP
In either VT102 or Tektronix mode, there are escape sequences to change the
name of the windows.
Additionally, in VT102 mode,
\fI\*n\fP implements the window-manipulation control
sequences from \fIdtterm\fP, such as resizing the window, setting its location
on the screen.
.
.PP
.I Xterm
allows character-based applications to receive mouse events (currently
button-press and release events, and button-motion events)
as keyboard control sequences.
See \fIXterm Control Sequences\fP for details.
.
.
.SH OPTIONS
The \fI\*n\fP terminal emulator
accepts the standard X Toolkit command line options as well as
many application-specific options.
If the option begins with a
.RB ` + '
instead of a
.RB ` \- ',
the option is restored to its default value.
The \fB\-version\fP and \fB\-help\fP options are interpreted even if \fI\*n\fP
cannot open the display, and are useful for testing and configuration scripts.
Along with \fB\-class\fP, they are checked before other options.
.TP 8
.B \-version
This causes \fI\*n\fP to print a version number to the standard output,
and then exit.
.TP 8
.B \-help
This causes \fI\*n\fP to print out a verbose message describing its options,
one per line.
The message is written to the standard output.
After printing the message, \fI\*n\fP exits.
\fI\*N\fP generates this message, sorting it and noting whether
a \*(``\fB\-\fR\fIoption\fP\*(''
or a \*(``\fB+\fR\fIoption\fP\*('' turns the feature on or off,
since some features historically have been one or the other.
\fI\*N\fP generates a concise help message (multiple options per line)
when an unknown option is used, e.g.,
.NS
\fB\*n \-z\fP
.NE
If the logic for a particular option such as logging is not compiled
into \fI\*n\fP, the help text for that option also is not displayed
by the \fB\-help\fP option.
.
.PP
One parameter (after all options) may be given.
That overrides \fI\*n\fP's built-in choice of shell program.
Normally \fI\*n\fP checks the SHELL variable.
If that is not set, \fI\*n\fP tries to use the shell program specified
in the password file.
If that is not set, \fI\*n\fP uses \fI/bin/sh\fP.
If the parameter is not a relative path, i.e.,
beginning with \*(``./\*('' or \*(``../\*('',
\fI\*n\fP looks for the file in the user's PATH.
In either case, it constructs an absolute path.
The \fB\-e\fP option cannot be used with this parameter since
it uses all parameters following the option.
.PP
The other options are used to control the appearance and behavior.
Not all options are necessarily configured into your copy of \fI\*n\fP:
.TP 8
.B \-132
Normally, the VT102 DECCOLM escape sequence that switches between 80 and
132 column mode is ignored.
This option causes the DECCOLM escape sequence to be recognized, and the
.I \*n
window will resize appropriately.
.TP 8
.B \-ah
This option indicates that
.I \*n
should always highlight the text cursor.
By default,
.I \*n
will display a hollow text cursor whenever the focus is lost or the
pointer leaves the window.
.TP 8
.B +ah
This option indicates that
.I \*n
should do text cursor highlighting based on focus.
.TP 8
.B \-ai
This option disables active icon support if that feature was compiled
into \fI\*n\fP.
This is equivalent to setting the \fIvt100\fP resource
\fBactiveIcon\fP to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B +ai
This option enables active icon support if that feature was compiled
into \fI\*n\fP.
This is equivalent to setting the \fIvt100\fP resource
\fBactiveIcon\fP to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B \-aw
This option indicates that auto-wraparound should be allowed.
This
allows the cursor to automatically wrap to the beginning of the next
line when it is at the rightmost position of a line and text is
output.
.TP 8
.B +aw
This option indicates that auto-wraparound should not be allowed.
.TP 8
.BI \-b " number"
This option specifies the size of the inner border (the distance between
the outer edge of the characters and the window border) in pixels.
That is the \fIvt100\fP \fIinternalBorder\fP resource.
The
default is \*(``2\*(''.
.TP 8
.B +bc
turn off text cursor blinking.
This overrides the \fBcursorBlink\fR resource.
.TP 8
.B \-bc
turn on text cursor blinking.
This overrides the \fBcursorBlink\fR resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-bcf " milliseconds"
set the amount of time text cursor is off when blinking via the
\fIcursorOffTime\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-bcn " milliseconds"
set the amount of time text cursor is on when blinking via the
\fIcursorOffTime\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "\-bdc"
Set the \fIvt100\fP resource \fBcolorBDMode\fR to \*(``false\*('',
disabling the display of characters with bold attribute as color
.TP 8
.B "+bdc"
Set the \fIvt100\fP resource \fBcolorBDMode\fR to \*(``true\*('',
enabling the display of characters with bold attribute as color
rather than bold
.TP 8
.B "\-cb"
Set the \fIvt100\fP resource \fBcutToBeginningOfLine\fP to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "+cb"
Set the \fIvt100\fP resource \fBcutToBeginningOfLine\fP to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "\-cc \fIcharacterclassrange\fP:\fIvalue\fP[,...]"
This sets classes indicated by the given ranges for using in selecting by
words.
See the section specifying character classes.
and discussion of the \fIcharClass\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "\-cjk_width"
Set the \fBcjkWidth\fP resource to \*(``true\*(''.
When turned on, characters with East Asian Ambiguous (A) category in UTR 11
have a column width of 2.
Otherwise, they have a column width of 1.
This may be useful for some legacy CJK text
terminal-based programs assuming box drawings and others to have a column
width of 2.
It also should be turned on when you specify a TrueType
CJK double-width (bi-width/monospace) font either with \fB\-fa\fP at
the command line or \fBfaceName\fP resource.
The default is \*(``false\*(''
.TP 8
.B "+cjk_width"
Reset the \fBcjkWidth\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-class " string"
This option allows you to override \fI\*n\fP's resource class.
Normally it is \*(``__default_class__\*('', but
can be set to another class such as \*(``U__default_class__\*('' to override selected resources.
.TP 8
.B "\-cm"
This option disables recognition of ANSI color-change escape sequences.
It sets the \fIcolorMode\fP resource to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "+cm"
This option enables recognition of ANSI color-change escape sequences.
This is the same as the \fIvt100\fP resource \fBcolorMode\fP.
.TP 8
.B "\-cn"
This option indicates that newlines should not be cut in line-mode
selections.
It sets the \fIcutNewline\fP resource to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B +cn
This option indicates that newlines should be cut in line-mode selections.
It sets the \fIcutNewline\fP resource to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI \-cr " color"
This option specifies the color to use for text cursor.
The default is to
use the same foreground color that is used for text.
It sets the \fIcursorColor\fP resource according to the parameter.
.TP 8
.B \-cu
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should work around a bug in the
.IR more (1)
program that causes it
to incorrectly display lines that are exactly the width of the window and
are followed by a line beginning with a tab
(the leading tabs are not displayed).
This option is so named because it was originally thought to be a bug
in the
.IR curses (3x)
cursor motion package.
.TP 8
.B +cu
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should not work around the
.IR more (1)
bug mentioned above.
.TP 8
.B "\-dc"
This option disables the escape sequence to change dynamic colors:
the vt100 foreground and background colors,
its text cursor color,
the pointer cursor foreground and background colors,
the Tektronix emulator foreground and background colors,
its text cursor color
and highlight color.
The option sets the \fIdynamicColors\fP option to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "+dc"
This option enables the escape sequence to change dynamic colors.
The option sets the \fIdynamicColors\fP option to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI \-e " program \fP[ \fIarguments \fP.\|.\|. ]\fI"
This option specifies the program (and its command line arguments) to be
run in the \fI\*n\fP window.
It also sets the window title and icon
name to be the basename of the program being executed if neither \fI\-T\fP
nor \fI\-n\fP are given on the command line.
\fBThis must be the last option on the command line.\fP
.TP 8
.BI \-en " encoding"
This option determines the encoding on which \fI\*n\fP runs.
It sets the \fBlocale\fR resource.
Encodings other than UTF-8 are supported by using \fIluit\fR.
The \fB\-lc\fR option should be used instead of \fB\-en\fR for
systems with locale support.
.TP 8
.BI \-fb " font"
This option specifies a font to be used when displaying bold text.
It sets the \fBboldFont\fR resource.
.IP
This font must be the same height and width as the normal font, otherwise it is ignored.
If only one of the normal or bold fonts is specified, it will be used as the
normal font and the bold font will be produced by overstriking this font.
.IP
See also the discussion of \fBboldMode\fP and \fBalwaysBoldMode\fP resources.
.TP 8
.BI \-fa " pattern"
This option sets the pattern for fonts selected from the FreeType
library if support for that library was compiled into \fI\*n\fP.
This corresponds to the \fBfaceName\fP resource.
When a CJK
double-width font is specified, you also need to turn
on the \fBcjkWidth\fP resource.
.IP
See also the \fBrenderFont\fP resource,
which combines with this to determine whether FreeType fonts are
initially active.
.TP 8
.BI \-fbb
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should compare normal and bold fonts bounding
boxes to ensure they are compatible.
It sets the \fBfreeBoldBox\fP resource to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI +fbb
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should not compare normal and bold fonts bounding
boxes to ensure they are compatible.
It sets the \fBfreeBoldBox\fP resource to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI \-fbx
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should not assume that the
normal and bold fonts have VT100 line-drawing characters.
If any are missing, \fI\*n\fP will draw the characters directly.
It sets the \fBforceBoxChars\fP resource to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI +fbx
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should assume that the
normal and bold fonts have VT100 line-drawing characters.
It sets the \fBforceBoxChars\fP resource to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI \-fd " pattern"
This option sets the pattern for double-width fonts selected from the FreeType
library if support for that library was compiled into \fI\*n\fP.
This corresponds to the \fBfaceNameDoublesize\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-fi " font"
This option sets the font for active icons if that feature was compiled
into \fI\*n\fP.
.IP
See also the discussion of the \fBiconFont\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-fs " size"
This option sets the pointsize for fonts selected from the FreeType
library if support for that library was compiled into \fI\*n\fP.
This corresponds to the \fBfaceSize\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-fullscreen
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should ask the window manager to
let it use the full-screen for display,
e.g., without window decorations.
It sets the \fBfullscreen\fP resource to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI +fullscreen
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should not ask the window manager to
let it use the full-screen for display.
It sets the \fBfullscreen\fP resource to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B \-fw \fIfont\fP
This option specifies the font to be used for displaying wide text.
By default,
it will attempt to use a font twice as wide as the font that will be used to
draw normal text.
If no double-width font is found, it will improvise, by stretching
the normal font.
This corresponds to the \fBwideFont\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B \-fwb \fIfont\fP
This option specifies the font to be used for displaying bold wide text.
By default,
it will attempt to use a font twice as wide as the font that will be used to
draw bold text.
If no double-width font is found, it will improvise, by stretching
the bold font.
This corresponds to the \fBwideBoldFont\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B \-fx \fIfont\fP
This option specifies the font to be used for displaying the preedit string
in the \*(``OverTheSpot\*('' input method.
.IP
See also the discussion of the \fBximFont\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-hc " color"
(see \fB\-selbg\fP).
.TP 8
.BI \-hf
This option indicates that HP Function Key escape codes should be generated
for function keys.
It sets the \fBhpFunctionKeys\fP resource to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI +hf
This option indicates that HP Function Key escape codes should not be generated
for function keys.
It sets the \fBhpFunctionKeys\fP resource to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI \-hm
Tells \fI\*n\fP to use
\fBhighlightTextColor\fP and \fBhighlightColor\fP
to override the reversed foreground/background colors in a selection.
It sets the \fBhighlightColorMode\fP resource to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI +hm
Tells \fI\*n\fP not to use
\fBhighlightTextColor\fP and \fBhighlightColor\fP
to override the reversed foreground/background colors in a selection.
It sets the \fBhighlightColorMode\fP resource to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI \-hold
Turn on the \fBhold\fP resource, i.e.,
\fI\*n\fP will not immediately destroy its window when the shell command completes.
It will wait until you use the window manager to destroy/kill the window, or
if you use the menu entries that send a signal, e.g., HUP or KILL.
.TP 8
.BI +hold
Turn off the \fBhold\fP resource, i.e.,
\fI\*n\fP will immediately destroy its window when the shell command completes.
.TP 8
.B \-ie
Turn on the \fBptyInitialErase\fP resource, i.e.,
use the pseudo-terminal's sense of the \fIstty\fP erase value.
.TP 8
.B +ie
Turn off the \fBptyInitialErase\fP resource, i.e.,
set the \fIstty\fP erase value using the \fBkb\fP string from the termcap entry as
a reference, if available.
.TP 8
.B \-im
Turn on the \fBuseInsertMode\fP resource,
which forces use of insert mode by adding appropriate entries to the TERMCAP
environment variable.
.TP 8
.B +im
Turn off the \fBuseInsertMode\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-into " windowId"
Given an X window identifier (an integer, which can be hexadecimal,
octal or decimal according to whether it begins with "0x", "0" or neither),
\fI\*n\fP will reparent its top-level shell widget to that window.
This is used to embed \fI\*n\fP within other applications.
.PP
For instance, there are scripts for Tcl/Tk and Gtk which can be used
to demonstrate the feature.
When using Gtk, there is a limitation of that toolkit which requires
that \fI\*n\fP's \fBallowSendEvents\fP resource is enabled.
.TP 8
.B \-j
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should do jump scrolling.
It corresponds to the \fBjumpScroll\fP resource.
Normally,
text is scrolled one line at a time; this option allows \fI\*n\fP to move
multiple lines at a time so that it does not fall as far behind.
Its use is
strongly recommended since it makes \fI\*n\fP much faster when scanning
through large amounts of text.
The VT100 escape sequences for enabling and
disabling smooth scroll as well as the \*(``VT Options\*(''
menu can be used to turn this
feature on or off.
.TP 8
.B +j
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should not do jump scrolling.
.TP 8
.B \-k8
This option sets the \fBallowC1Printable\fP resource.
When \fBallowC1Printable\fP is set, \fI\*n\fP overrides the mapping
of C1 control characters (code 128-159) to treat them as printable.
.TP 8
.B +k8
This option resets the \fBallowC1Printable\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-kt " keyboardtype"
This option sets the \fBkeyboardType\fP resource.
Possible values include:
\*(``unknown\*('',
\*(``default\*('',
\*(``hp\*('',
\*(``sco\*('',
\*(``sun\*('',
\*(``tcap\*('' and
\*(``vt220\*(''.
.IP
The value \*(``unknown\*('',
causes the corresponding resource to be ignored.
.IP
The value \*(``default\*('',
suppresses the associated resources
.BR hpFunctionKeys ,
.BR scoFunctionKeys ,
.BR sunFunctionKeys,
.BR tcapFunctionKeys
and
.BR sunKeyboard ,
using the Sun/PC keyboard layout.
.TP 8
.B \-l
Turn logging on.
Normally logging is not supported, due to security concerns.
Some versions of \fI\*n\fP may have logging enabled.
The logfile is written to the directory from which \fI\*n\fP is
invoked.
The filename is generated, of the form
.sp
	XtermLog.\fIXXXXXX\fR
.sp
or
.sp
	Xterm.log.\fIhostname.yyyy.mm.dd.hh.mm.ss.XXXXXX\fR
.sp
depending on how \fI\*n\fP was built.
.TP 8
.B +l
Turn logging off.
.TP 8
.B \-lc
Turn on support of various encodings according to the users'
locale setting, i.e., LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG environment variables.
This is achieved by turning on UTF-8 mode and by invoking \fIluit\fR for
conversion between locale encodings and UTF-8.
(\fIluit\fR is not invoked in UTF-8 locales.)
This corresponds to the \fBlocale\fR resource.
.IP
The actual list of encodings which are supported is determined by \fIluit\fR.
Consult the \fIluit\fR manual page for further details.
.IP
See also the discussion of the \fB\-u8\fP option which supports UTF-8 locales.
.TP 8
.B +lc
Turn off support of automatic selection of locale encodings.
Conventional 8bit mode or, in UTF-8 locales or with \fB\-u8\fP option,
UTF-8 mode will be used.
.TP 8
.BI \-lcc " path"
File name for the encoding converter from/to locale encodings
and UTF-8 which is used with \fB\-lc\fP option or \fBlocale\fR resource.
This corresponds to the \fBlocaleFilter\fR resource.
.TP 8
.B \-leftbar
Force scrollbar to the left side of VT100 screen.
This is the default, unless you have set the rightScrollBar resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-lf " filename"
Specify the log-filename.
See the \fB\-l\fP option.
.TP 8
.B \-ls
This option indicates that the shell that is started in the \fI\*n\fP window
will be a login shell (i.e., the first character of argv[0] will be a dash,
indicating to the shell that it should read the user's .login or .profile).
.IP
The \fB\-ls\fP flag and the \fBloginShell\fP resource
are ignored if \fB\-e\fP is also given,
because \fI\*n\fP does not know how to make the shell
start the given command after whatever it does when it is a login
shell \- the user's shell of choice need not be a Bourne shell after all.
Also, \fI\*n\ \-e\fP is supposed to provide a consistent
functionality for other applications that need to start text-mode
programs in a window, and if \fBloginShell\fP were not ignored, the
result of ~/.profile might interfere with that.
.IP
If you do want the effect of \fB\-ls\fP and \fB\-e\fP simultaneously, you
may get away with something like
.NS 15
\*n \-e /bin/bash \-l \-c "my command here"
.NE
Finally, \fB\-ls\fP is not completely ignored,
because \fI\*n\ \-ls\ \-e\fP does write a \fI/etc/wtmp\fP entry
(if configured to do so),
whereas \fI\*n\ \-e\fP does not.
.TP 8
.B \-maximized
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should ask the window manager to
maximize its layout on startup.
This corresponds to the \fBmaximized\fP resource.
.IP
Maximizing is not the reverse of iconifying;
it is possible to do both with certain window managers.
.TP 8
.B +maximized
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should ask the window manager to
not maximize its layout on startup.
.TP 8
.B +ls
This option indicates that the shell that is started should not be a login
shell (i.e., it will be a normal \*(``subshell\*('').
.TP 8
.B \-mb
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should ring a margin bell when
the user types near the right end of a line.
.TP 8
.B +mb
This option indicates that margin bell should not be rung.
.TP 8
.BI \-mc " milliseconds"
This option specifies the maximum time between multi-click selections.
.TP 8
.B \-mesg
Turn off the \fBmessages\fP resource, i.e.,
disallow write access to the terminal.
.TP 8
.B +mesg
Turn on the \fBmessages\fP resource, i.e.,
allow write access to the terminal.
.TP 8
.B "\-mk_width"
Set the \fBmkWidth\fP resource to \*(``true\*(''.
This makes \fI\*n\fP use a built-in version of the wide-character width
calculation.
The default is \*(``false\*(''
.TP 8
.B "+mk_width"
Reset the \fBmkWidth\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-ms " color"
This option specifies the color to be used for the pointer cursor.
The default
is to use the foreground color.
This sets the \fIpointerColor\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-nb " number"
This option specifies the number of characters from the right end of a line
at which the margin bell, if enabled, will ring.
The default is \*(``10\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "\-nul"
This option disables the display of underlining.
.TP 8
.B "+nul"
This option enables the display of underlining.
.TP 8
.B \-pc
This option enables the PC-style use of bold colors (see boldColors
resource).
.TP 8
.B +pc
This option disables the PC-style use of bold colors.
.TP 8
.B \-pob
This option indicates that the window should be raised whenever a
Control-G is received.
.TP 8
.B +pob
This option indicates that the window should not be raised whenever a
Control-G is received.
.TP 8
.B \-rightbar
Force scrollbar to the right side of VT100 screen.
.TP 8
.B "\-rvc"
This option disables the display of characters with reverse attribute as color.
.TP 8
.B "+rvc"
This option enables the display of characters with reverse attribute as color.
.TP 8
.B \-rw
This option indicates that reverse-wraparound should be allowed.
This allows
the cursor to back up from the leftmost column of one line to the rightmost
column of the previous line.
This is very useful for editing long shell
command lines and is encouraged.
This option can be turned on and off from
the \*(``VT Options\*('' menu.
.TP 8
.B +rw
This option indicates that reverse-wraparound should not be allowed.
.TP 8
.B \-s
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP may scroll asynchronously, meaning that
the screen does not have to be kept completely up to date while scrolling.
This allows \fI\*n\fP to run faster when network latencies are very high
and is typically useful when running across a very large internet or many
gateways.
.TP 8
.B +s
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should scroll synchronously.
.TP 8
.B \-samename
Does not send title and icon name change requests when the request
would have no effect: the name is not changed.
This has the advantage
of preventing flicker and the disadvantage of requiring an extra
round trip to the server to find out the previous value.
In practice
this should never be a problem.
.TP 8
.B +samename
Always send title and icon name change requests.
.TP 8
.B \-sb
This option indicates that some number of lines that are scrolled off the top
of the window should be saved and that a scrollbar should be displayed so that
those lines can be viewed.
This option may be turned on and off from the
\*(``VT Options\*('' menu.
.TP 8
.B +sb
This option indicates that a scrollbar should not be displayed.
.TP 8
.BI \-selbg " color"
This option specifies the color to use for the background of selected text.
If not specified, reverse video is used.
See the discussion of the \fBhighlightColor\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-selfg " color"
This option specifies the color to use for selected text.
If not specified, reverse video is used.
See the discussion of the \fBhighlightTextColor\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B \-sf
This option indicates that Sun Function Key escape codes should be generated
for function keys.
.TP 8
.B +sf
This option indicates that the standard escape codes should be generated for
function keys.
.TP 8
.BI \-sh " number"
scale line-height values by the given number.
See the discussion of the \fBscaleHeight\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B \-si
This option indicates that output to a window should not automatically
reposition the screen to the bottom of the scrolling region.
This option can be turned on and off from the \*(``VT Options\*('' menu.
.TP 8
.B +si
This option indicates that output to a window should cause it to
scroll to the bottom.
.TP 8
.B \-sk
This option indicates that pressing a key while
using the scrollbar to review previous lines of text should
cause the window to be repositioned automatically in the normal position at the
bottom of the scroll region.
.TP 8
.B +sk
This option indicates that pressing a key while using the scrollbar
should not cause the window to be repositioned.
.TP 8
.BI \-sl " number"
This option specifies the number of lines to save that have been scrolled
off the top of the screen.
This corresponds to the \fBsaveLines\fP resource.
The default is \*(``64\*(''.
.TP 8
.B \-sm
This option, corresponding to the \fBsessionMgt\fR resource,
indicates that \fI\*n\fR should
set up session manager callbacks.
.TP 8
.B +sm
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fR should
not set up session manager callbacks.
.TP 8
.B \-sp
This option indicates that Sun/PC keyboard should be assumed,
providing mapping for keypad \*(``+' to \*(``,', and
CTRL-F1 to F13, CTRL-F2 to F14, etc.
.TP 8
.B +sp
This option indicates that the standard escape codes should be generated for
keypad and function keys.
.TP 8
.B \-t
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should start in Tektronix mode, rather
than in VT102 mode.
Switching between the two windows is done using the
\*(``Options\*('' menus.
.IR Termcap (5)
entries that work with
.I \*n
\*(``tek4014\*('',
\*(``tek4015\*('',
\*(``tek4012\*('',
\*(``tek4013\*('',
\*(``tek4010\*('', and
\*(``dumb\*(''.
.I \*n
automatically searches the termcap file in this order for these entries and then
sets the \*(``TERM\*('' and the \*(``TERMCAP\*('' environment variables.
.TP 8
.B +t
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should start in VT102 mode.
.TP 8
.B \-tb
This option, corresponding to the \fBtoolBar\fR resource,
indicates that \fI\*n\fR should display a toolbar (or menubar)
at the top of its window.
The buttons in the toolbar correspond to
the popup menus, e.g., control/left/mouse for \*(``Main Options\*(''.
.TP 8
.B +tb
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fR should
not set up a toolbar.
.TP 8
.BI \-ti " term_id"
Specify the name used by \fI\*n\fP to select the
correct response to terminal ID queries.
It also specifies the emulation level,
used to determine the type of response to a DA control sequence.
Valid values include vt52, vt100, vt101, vt102, and vt220
(the \*(``vt\*('' is optional).
The default is \*(``vt__default_termid__\*(''.
The term_id argument specifies the terminal ID to use.
(This is the same as the \fBdecTerminalID\fP resource).
.TP 8
.BI \-tm " string"
This option specifies a series of terminal setting keywords followed by the
characters that should be bound to those functions, similar to the \fIstty\fP
program.
The keywords and their values are described in detail in the \fBttyModes\fP
resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-tn " name"
This option specifies the name of the terminal type to be set in the TERM
environment variable.
It corresponds to the \fBtermName\fP resource.
This terminal type must exist in the terminal
database
(termcap or terminfo, depending on how \fI\*n\fP is built)
and should have \fIli#\fP and \fIco#\fP entries.
If the terminal type is not found, \fI\*n\fP uses the built-in list
\*(``xterm\*('', \*(``vt102\*('', etc.
.TP 8
.B \-u8
This option sets the \fButf8\fP resource.
When \fButf8\fP is set, \fI\*n\fP interprets incoming data as UTF-8.
This sets the \fBwideChars\fP resource as a side-effect,
but the UTF-8 mode set by this option prevents it from being turned off.
If you must turn it on and off, use the \fBwideChars\fP resource.
.IP
This option and the \fButf8\fR resource are overridden by
the \fB\-lc\fP and \fB\-en\fP options and \fBlocale\fR resource.
That is, if \fI\*n\fP has been compiled to support \fIluit\fR,
and the \fBlocale\fP resource is not \*(``false\*(''
this option is ignored.
We recommend using
the \fB\-lc\fR option or the \*(``\fBlocale:\ true\fR\*('' resource
in UTF-8 locales when your operating system supports locale,
or \fB\-en\ UTF-8\fP option or the \*(``\fBlocale:\ UTF-8\fR\*('' resource
when your operating system does not support locale.
.TP 8
.B +u8
This option resets the \fButf8\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "\-uc"
This option makes the cursor underlined instead of a box.
.TP 8
.B "+uc"
This option makes the cursor a box instead of underlined.
.TP 8
.B "\-ulc"
This option disables the display of characters with underline attribute as
color rather than with underlining.
.TP 8
.B "+ulc"
This option enables the display of characters with underline attribute as
color rather than with underlining.
.TP 8
.B "\-ulit"
This option, corresponding to the \fBitalicULMode\fP resource,
disables the display of characters with underline attribute as
italics rather than with underlining.
.TP 8
.B "+ulit"
This option, corresponding to the \fBitalicULMode\fP resource,
enables the display of characters with underline attribute as
italics rather than with underlining.
.TP 8
.B \-ut
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should not write a record into the
the system \fIutmp\fP log file.
.TP 8
.B +ut
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should write a record into
the system \fIutmp\fP log file.
.TP 8
.B \-vb
This option indicates that a visual bell is preferred over an audible one.
Instead of ringing the terminal bell whenever a Control-G is received, the
window will be flashed.
.TP 8
.B +vb
This option indicates that a visual bell should not be used.
.TP 8
.B \-wc
This option sets the \fBwideChars\fP resource.
When \fBwideChars\fP is set, \fI\*n\fP maintains internal structures for 16-bit
characters.
If you do not set this resource to \*(``true\*('',
\fI\*n\fP will ignore the escape sequence which turns UTF-8 mode on and off.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B +wc
This option resets the \fBwideChars\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B \-wf
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should wait for the window to be mapped
the first time before starting the subprocess so that the initial terminal
size settings and environment variables are correct.
It is the application's
responsibility to catch subsequent terminal size changes.
.TP 8
.B +wf
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should not wait before starting the
subprocess.
.TP 8
.B \-ziconbeep \fIpercent\fP
Same as \fBzIconBeep\fP resource.
If percent is non-zero, xterms that produce output while iconified
will cause an XBell sound at the given volume
and have \*(``***\*('' prepended to their icon titles.
Most window managers will detect this change immediately, showing you
which window has the output.
(A similar feature was in x10 \fI\*n\fP.)
.TP 8
.B \-C
This option indicates that this window should receive console output.
This
is not supported on all systems.
To obtain console output, you must be the
owner of the console device, and you must have read and write permission
for it.
If you are running X under \fIxdm\fP on the console screen you may
need to have the session startup and reset programs explicitly change the
ownership of the console device in order to get this option to work.
.TP 8
.B \-S\fIccn\fP
This option allows \fI\*n\fP to be used as an input and
output channel for an existing program and is sometimes used in specialized
applications.
The option value specifies the last few letters of the name of a pseudo-terminal
to use in slave mode, plus the number of the inherited file descriptor.
If the option contains a \*(``/\*('' character, that delimits the characters
used for the pseudo-terminal name from the file descriptor.
Otherwise, exactly two characters are used from the option for
the pseudo-terminal name, the remainder is the file descriptor.
Examples
(the first two are equivalent
since the descriptor follows the last \*(``/\*(''):
.NS 15
-S/dev/pts/123/45
-S123/45
-Sab34
.NE
Note that \fI\*n\fP does not close any file descriptor
which it did not open for its own use.
It is possible (though probably not portable) to have an application
which passes an open file descriptor down to \fI\*n\fP past the
initialization or the \fB\-S\fP option to a process running in the \fI\*n\fP.
.PP
The following command line arguments are provided for compatibility with
older versions.
They may not be supported in the next release as the X
Toolkit provides standard options that accomplish the same task.
.TP 8
.B "%\fIgeom\fP"
This option specifies the preferred size and position of the Tektronix window.
It is shorthand for specifying the \*(``\fI*tekGeometry\fP\*('' resource.
.TP 8
.B "#\fIgeom\fP"
This option specifies the preferred position of the icon window.
It is shorthand for specifying the \*(``\fI*iconGeometry\fP\*('' resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-T " string"
This option specifies the title for \fI\*n\fP's windows.
It is equivalent to \fB\-title\fP.
.TP 8
.BI \-n " string"
This option specifies the icon name for \fI\*n\fP's windows.
It is shorthand for specifying the \*(``\fI*iconName\fP\*('' resource.
Note that this is not the same as the toolkit option \fB\-name\fP (see below).
The default icon name is the application name.
.IP
If no suitable icon is found, \fI\*n\fP provides a compiled-in pixmap.
.TP 8
.B \-r
This option indicates that reverse video should be simulated by swapping
the foreground and background colors.
It is equivalent to
\fB\-rv\fP.
.TP 8
.BI \-w " number"
This option specifies the width in pixels of the border surrounding the window.
It is equivalent to \fB\-borderwidth\fP or \fB\-bw\fP.
.
.PP
The following standard X Toolkit command line arguments are commonly used
with \fI\*n\fP:
.TP 8
.B \-bd \fIcolor\fP
This option specifies the color to use for the border of the window.
The corresponding resource name is \fIborderColor\fP.
\fI\*n\fP uses the X Toolkit default, which is \*(``XtDefaultForeground\*(''.
.TP 8
.B \-bg \fIcolor\fP
This option specifies the color to use for the background of the window.
The corresponding resource name is \fIbackground\fP.
The default is \*(``XtDefaultBackground\*(''.
.TP 8
.B \-bw \fInumber\fP
This option specifies the width in pixels of the border surrounding the window.
.IP
This appears to be a legacy of older X releases.
It sets the \fBborderWidth\fP resource of the shell widget,
and may provide advice to your window manager to set the thickness of the
window frame.
Most window managers do not use this information.
See the \fB\-b\fP option, which controls the inner border of the \fI\*n\fP
window.
.TP 8
.B \-display \fIdisplay\fP
This option specifies the X server to contact; see \fIX(__miscmansuffix__)\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-fg \fIcolor\fP
This option specifies the color to use for displaying text.
The corresponding resource name is \fIforeground\fP.
The default is
\*(``XtDefaultForeground\*(''.
.TP 8
.B \-fn \fIfont\fP
This option specifies the font to be used for displaying normal text.
The corresponding resource name is \fIfont\fP.
The resource value default is \fIfixed\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-font \fIfont\fP
This is the same as \fB\-fn\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-geometry \fIgeometry\fP
This option specifies the preferred size and position of the VT102 window;
see \fIX(__miscmansuffix__)\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-iconic
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should ask the window manager to
start it as an icon rather than as the normal window.
The corresponding resource name is \fIiconic\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-name \fIname\fP
This option specifies the application name under which resources are to be
obtained, rather than the default executable file name.
\fIName\fP should not contain \*(``.\*('' or \*(``*\*('' characters.
.TP 8
.B \-rv
This option indicates that reverse video should be simulated by swapping
the foreground and background colors.
The corresponding resource name is \fIreverseVideo\fP.
.TP 8
.B +rv
Disable the simulation of reverse video by swapping foreground and background
colors.
.TP 8
.B \-title \fIstring\fP
This option specifies the window title string, which may be displayed by
window managers if the user so chooses.
The default title is the command
line specified after the \fB\-e\fP option, if any, otherwise the application
name.
.TP 8
.B \-xrm \fIresourcestring\fP
This option specifies a resource string to be used.
This is especially
useful for setting resources that do not have separate command line options.
.
.
.SH RESOURCES
The program understands all of the core X Toolkit resource names and classes.
Application specific resources (e.g., \*(``\fB__default_class__.\fP\fINAME\fP\*('') follow:
.TP 8
.B "backarrowKeyIsErase (\fPclass\fB BackarrowKeyIsErase)"
Tie the VTxxx \fBbackarrowKey\fP and \fBptyInitialErase\fP resources
together by setting the DECBKM state according to whether the initial value of
\fIstty\fP erase is a backspace (8) or delete (127) character.
A \*(``false\*('' value disables this feature.
The default is \*(``__backarrow_key_erase__\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "fullscreen (\fPclass\fB Fullscreen)"
Specifies whether or not \fI\*n\fP should ask the window manager to
use a fullscreen layout on startup.
\fI\*N\fP accepts either a keyword (ignoring case)
or the number shown in parentheses:
.RS
.TP 3
false (0)
Fullscreen layout is not used initially,
but may be later via menu-selection or control sequence.
.TP 3
true (1)
Fullscreen layout is used initially,
but may be disabled later via menu-selection or control sequence.
.TP 3
always (2)
Fullscreen layout is used initially,
and cannot be disabled later via menu-selection or control sequence.
.TP 3
never (3)
Fullscreen layout is not used,
and cannot be enabled later via menu-selection or control sequence.
.RE
.IP
The default is
\*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "hold (\fPclass\fB Hold)"
If true,
\fI\*n\fP will not immediately destroy its window when the shell command completes.
It will wait until you use the window manager to destroy/kill the window, or
if you use the menu entries that send a signal, e.g., HUP or KILL.
You may scroll back, select text, etc., to perform most graphical operations.
Resizing the display will lose data, however, since this involves interaction
with the shell which is no longer running.
.TP 8
.B "hpFunctionKeys (\fPclass\fB HpFunctionKeys)"
Specifies whether or not HP Function Key escape codes should be generated for
function keys instead of standard escape sequences.
.IP
See also the \fBkeyboardType\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "iconGeometry (\fPclass\fB IconGeometry)"
Specifies the preferred size and position of the application when iconified.
It is not necessarily obeyed by all window managers.
.TP 8
.B "iconName (\fPclass\fB IconName)"
Specifies the icon name.
\fI\*n\fP provides no default value;
some window managers may assume the application name, e.g., \*(``\*n\*(''.
.IP
If the \fBiconName\fP resource is given (or is set via the \fB\-n\fP option)
\fI\*n\fP searches for a pixmap file with that name,
possibly adding a \*(``.xpm\*('' suffix.
If it is able to load that file, \fI\*n\fP sets the window manager
hint for the icon-pixmap.
These pixmaps are distributed with \fI\*n\fP, and can optionally be
compiled-in:
.RS
.bP
mini.\*n_16x16,
mini.\*n_32x32,
mini.\*n_48x48
.bP
filled-\*n_16x16
filled-\*n_32x32
filled-\*n_48x48
.bP
\*n_16x16
\*n_32x32
\*n_48x48
.bP
\*n-color_16x16
\*n-color_32x32
\*n-color_48x48
.RE
.IP
In either case, \fI\*n\fP allows for adding a \*(``_48x48\*('' to specify the
largest of the pixmaps as a default.
That is, \*(``mini.\*n\*('' is the same as \*(``mini.\*n_48x48\*(''.
.IP
If no \fBiconName\fP resource is given
(or if none of the compiled-in names matches),
\*n uses \*(``mini.\*n\*('' (which is always compiled-in).
.IP
The \fBiconName\fP resource has no effect on \*(``desktop\*('' files,
including \*(``panel\*('' and \*(``menu\*(''.
Those are typically set via a \*(``.desktop\*('' file;
\fI\*n\fP provides samples for itself (and the \fIu\*n\fP script).
The more capable desktop systems allow changing the icon on a per-user basis.
.TP 8
.B "keyboardType (\fPclass\fB KeyboardType)"
Enables one (or none) of the various keyboard-type resources:
\fBhpFunctionKeys\fP,
\fBscoFunctionKeys\fP,
\fBsunFunctionKeys\fP,
\fBtcapFunctionKeys\fP and
\fBsunKeyboard\fP.
The resource's value should be one of the corresponding strings
\*(``hp\*('',
\*(``sco\*('',
\*(``sun\*('',
\*(``tcap\*('' or
\*(``vt220\*(''.
The individual resources are provided for legacy support;
this resource is simpler to use.
.IP
The default is
\*(``unknown\*('', i.e., none of the associated resources are set
via this resource.
.TP 8
.B "maxBufSize (\fPclass\fB MaxBufSize)"
Specify the maximum size of the input buffer.
The default is \*(``32768\*(''.
You cannot set this to a value less than the \fBminBufSize\fR resource.
It will be increased as needed to make that value evenly divide this one.
.IP
On some systems you may want to increase one or both of the
\fBmaxBufSize\fP and
\fBminBufSize\fP resource values to achieve better performance
if the operating system prefers larger buffer sizes.
.TP 8
.B "maximized (\fPclass\fB Maximized)"
Specifies whether or not \fI\*n\fP should ask the window manager to
maximize its layout on startup.
The default is
\*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "messages (\fPclass\fB Messages)"
Specifies whether write access to the terminal is allowed initially.
See
.BR mesg (1).
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 9
.B "menuLocale (\fPclass\fB MenuLocale)"
Specify the locale used for character-set computations when loading
the popup menus.
Use this to improve initialization performance of the Athena popup menus,
which may load unnecessary (and very large) fonts, e.g.,
in a locale having UTF-8 encoding.
The default is \*(``C\*('' (POSIX).
.IP
To use the current locale
(only useful if you have localized the resource settings for the menu entries),
set the resource to an empty string.
.TP 8
.B "minBufSize (\fPclass\fB MinBufSize)"
Specify the minimum size of the input buffer, i.e., the amount of data
that \fI\*n\fR requests on each read.
The default is \*(``4096\*(''.
You cannot set this to a value less than 64.
.TP 8
.B "omitTranslation (\fPclass\fB OmitTranslation)"
Selectively omit one or more parts of \fI\*n\fP's default translations
at startup.
The resource value is a comma-separated list of keywords,
which may be abbreviated:
\*(``fullscreen\*('',
\*(``scroll-lock\*('',
\*(``shift-fonts\*('' or
\*(``wheel-mouse\*(''.
\fI\*N\fP also recognizes \*(``default\*('',
but omitting that will make the program unusable

.TP 8
.B "ptySttySize (\fPclass\fB PtySttySize)
If \*(``true\*('', \fI\*n\fP will reset the screen size after
terminal initialization is complete.
This is needed for some systems whose pseudo-terminals cannot
propagate terminal characteristics.
Where it is not needed, it can interfere with other methods for
setting the intial screen size, e.g., via window manager interaction.
.IP
See also \fBwaitForMap\fP which waits for a handshake-message
giving the pseudo-terminal's notion of the screen size.
The default is \*(``false\*('' on Linux and OS X systems,

.B "sameName (\fPclass\fB SameName)"
If the value of this resource is \*(``true\*('', \fI\*n\fP does not send
title and icon name change requests when the request

In practice
this should never be a problem.

While this resource applies to either bitmap or TrueType fonts,
its main purpose is to
help work around incompatible changes in the Xft library's font metrics.
\fI\*N\fP checks the font metrics to find what the library claims are
the bounding boxes for each glyph (character).
However, some of Xft's features (such as the autohinter) can cause the
glyphs to be scaled larger than the bounding boxes, and be partly overwritten
by the next row.
.IP

.TP 8
.B "scoFunctionKeys (\fPclass\fB ScoFunctionKeys)"
Specifies whether or not SCO Function Key escape codes should be generated for
function keys instead of standard escape sequences.

.IP
See also the \fBkeyboardType\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "sunKeyboard (\fPclass\fB SunKeyboard)"
Specifies whether or not Sun/PC keyboard layout should be assumed rather
than DEC VT220.
This causes the keypad \*(``+' to be mapped to \*(``,'.
and
CTRL F1-F12 to F11-F20, depending on the setting of the \fBctrlFKeys\fP
resource.
so \fI\*n\fP emulates a DEC VT220 more accurately.
Otherwise (the default, with \fBsunKeyboard\fP set to \*(``false\*(''),
\fI\*n\fP uses PC-style bindings for the function keys and keypad.
.IP
PC-style bindings
use the Shift, Alt, Control and Meta keys as modifiers for function-keys
and keypad
(see the document \fIXterm Control Sequences\fP for details).
The PC-style bindings are analogous to PCTerm, but not the same thing.
Normally these bindings do not conflict with the use of the Meta key
as described for the \fBeightBitInput\fP resource.
If they do, note that the PC-style bindings are evaluated first.
.IP
See also the \fBkeyboardType\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "tcapFunctionKeys (\fPclass\fB TcapFunctionKeys)"
Specifies whether or not function key escape codes read from the
termcap/terminfo entry should be generated for

.B "toolBar (\fPclass\fB ToolBar)"
Specifies whether or not the toolbar should be displayed.
The default is
\*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "ttyModes (\fPclass\fB TtyModes)"
Specifies a string containing terminal setting keywords and the characters
to which they may be bound.
Allowable keywords include:
brk,
dsusp,
eof,
eol,
eol2,
erase,
erase2,
flush,
intr,
kill,
lnext,
quit,
rprnt,
start,
status,
stop,
susp,
swtch and
weras.
Control characters may be specified as ^char (e.g., ^c or ^u)
and \fB^?\fP may be used to indicate delete (127).
Use \fB^\-\fP to denote \fIundef\fP.
Use \fB\\034\fP to represent \fB^\\\fP, since a literal backslash in
an X resource escapes the next character.
.IP
This is very useful for overriding
the default terminal settings without having to do an \fIstty\fP every time
an \fI\*n\fP is started.
Note, however, that the \fIstty\fP program on a given host may use different
keywords; \fI\*n\fR's table is built-in.
.IP
If the \fBttyModes\fP resource specifies a value for \fBerase\fP,
that overrides the \fBptyInitialErase\fP resource setting,
i.e., \fI\*n\fP initializes the terminal to match that value.
.TP 8
.B "useInsertMode (\fPclass\fB UseInsertMode)"
Force use of insert mode by adding appropriate entries to the TERMCAP
environment variable.
This is useful if the system termcap is broken.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "utmpDisplayId (\fPclass\fB UtmpDisplayId)"
Specifies whether or not \fI\*n\fP should try to record the display
identifier (display number and screen number) as well as the hostname in
the system \fIutmp\fP log file.
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "utmpInhibit (\fPclass\fB UtmpInhibit)"
Specifies whether or not \fI\*n\fP should try to record the user's terminal

the system \fIutmp\fP log file.
If true, \fI\*n\fP will not try.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "waitForMap (\fPclass\fB WaitForMap)"
Specifies whether or not \fI\*n\fP should wait for the initial window map
before starting the subprocess.
This is part of the
.B ptyHandshake
logic.
When \fI\*n\fP is directed to wait in this fashion,
it passes the terminal size from the display end of the pseudo-terminal
to the terminal I/O connection, e.g., according to the window manager.
Otherwise, it uses the size as given in resource values or command-line
option \fB\-geom\fP.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "zIconBeep (\fPclass\fB ZIconBeep)"
Same as \-ziconbeep command line argument.
If the value of this resource is non-zero, xterms that produce output
while iconified will cause an XBell sound at the given volume
and have \*(``***\ \*('' prepended to their icon titles.
Most window managers will detect this change immediately, showing you
which window has the output.
(A similar feature was in x10 \fI\*n\fR.)
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "zIconTitleFormat (\fPclass\fB ZIconTitleFormat)"
Allow customization of the string used in the \fBzIconBeep\fP feature.
The default value is \*(``***\ %s\*(''.
.IP
If the resource value contains a \*(``%s\*('',
then \fI\*n\fP inserts the icon title at that point rather
than prepending the string to the icon title.
(Only the first \*(``%s\*('' is used).
.\"
.SS VT100 Widget Resources
.PP
The following resources are specified as part
of the \fIvt100\fP widget (class \fIVT100\fP).
They are specified by patterns such as \*(``\fB__default_class__.vt100.\fP\fINAME\fP\*(''.
.PP
If your \fI\*n\fP is configured to support the \*(``toolbar\*('', then those
patterns need an extra level for the form-widget which holds the
toolbar and vt100 widget.
A wildcard between the top-level
\*(``__default_class__\*('' and the \*(``vt100\*('' widget makes the resource settings work for
either, e.g., \*(``\fB__default_class__*vt100.\fP\fINAME\fP\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "activeIcon (\fPclass\fB ActiveIcon)"
Specifies whether or not active icon windows are to be used when the
\fI\*n\fP window is iconified, if this feature is compiled into \fI\*n\fR.
The active icon is a miniature representation of the content of the
window and will update as the content changes.
Not all window managers necessarily support application icon windows.
Some window managers
will allow you to enter keystrokes into the active icon window.
The default is \*(``default\*(''.
.IP
\fI\*N\fP accepts either a keyword (ignoring case)
or the number shown in parentheses:
.RS
.TP
false (0)
No active icon is shown.
.TP
true (1)
The active icon is shown.
If you are using \fItwm\fP, use this setting to enable active-icons.
.TP
default (2)
\fI\*n\fP checks at startup, and shows an active icon only for window
managers which it can identify and which are known to support the feature.
These are \fIfvwm\fP (full support), and \fIwindow maker\fP (limited).
A few other windows managers (such as \fItwm\fP), support active icons,
but do not support the extensions which allow \fI\*n\fP
to identify the window manager.
.TP 8
.B "allowBoldFonts (\fPclass\fB AllowBoldFonts)"
When set to \*(``false\*('', \fI\*n\fP will not use bold fonts.
This overrides both the \fBalwaysBoldMode\fP and the \fBboldMode\fP resources.
.B "alwaysBoldMode (\fPclass\fB AlwaysBoldMode)"
.TP 8
.B "allowC1Printable (\fPclass\fB AllowC1Printable)"
If true, overrides the mapping of C1 controls
(codes 128-159) to make them be treated
as if they were printable characters.
Although this corresponds to no particular standard,
some users insist it is a VT100.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP
.B "allowColorOps (\fPclass\fB AllowColorOps)"
Specifies whether control sequences that set/query the dynamic colors should be allowed.
ANSI colors are unaffected by this resource setting.
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.TP
.B "allowFontOps (\fPclass\fB AllowFontOps)"
Specifies whether control sequences that set/query the font should be allowed.
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "allowScrollLock (\fPclass\fB AllowScrollLock)"
Specifies whether control sequences that set/query
the Scroll Lock key should be allowed,
as well as whether the Scroll Lock key responds to user's keypress.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.IP
When this feature is enabled, \fI\*n\fP will sense the state of the
Scroll Lock key each time it acquires focus.
Pressing the Scroll Lock key toggles \fI\*n\fP's internal state,
as well as toggling the associated LED.
While the Scroll Lock is active, \fI\*n\fP attempts to keep a viewport on the
same set of lines.
If the current viewport is scrolled past the limit set by the
\fBsaveLines\fP resource, then Scroll Lock has no further effect.
.IP
The reason for setting the default to \*(``false\*('' is to avoid
user surprise.
This key is generally unused in keyboard configurations,
and has not acquired a standard meaning even when it is used in that manner.
Consequently, users have assigned it for ad hoc purposes.
.TP 8
.B "allowSendEvents (\fPclass\fB AllowSendEvents)"
Specifies whether or not synthetic key and button events (generated using
the X protocol SendEvent request) should be interpreted or discarded.
The default is \*(``false\*('' meaning they are discarded.
Note that allowing such events would create a very large security hole, therefore
enabling this resource forcefully disables the \fBallow\fP\fIXXX\fP\fBOps\fR resources.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP
.B "allowTcapOps (\fPclass\fB AllowTcapOps)"
Specifies whether control sequences that query the terminal's
notion of its function-key strings, as termcap or terminfo capabilities
should be allowed.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.IP
A few programs, e.g., \fIvim\fP, use this feature to get an accurate
description of the terminal's capabilities,
independent of the termcap/terminfo setting:
.RS
.bP
\fI\*n\fP can tell the querying program how many colors it supports.
This is a constant, depending on how it is compiled, typically 16.
It does not change if you alter resource settings,
e.g., the \fBboldColors\fP resource.
.bP
\fI\*n\fP can tell the querying program what strings are sent by modified
(shift-, control-, alt-) function- and keypad-keys.
Reporting control- and alt-modifiers is a feature that relies on the
\fIncurses\fP extended naming.
.RE
.TP
.B "allowTitleOps (\fPclass\fB AllowTitleOps)"
Specifies whether control sequences that modify the window title or icon name
should be allowed.
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.TP
.B "allowWindowOps (\fPclass\fB AllowWindowOps)"
Specifies whether extended window control sequences
(as used in \fIdtterm\fP)
should be allowed.
These include several control sequences which manipulate the window size or
position, as well as reporting these values and the title or icon name.
Each of these can be abused in a script;
curiously enough most terminal emulators that implement these
restrict only a small part of the repertoire.
For fine-tuning, see \fBdisallowedWindowOps\fP.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "altIsNotMeta (\fPclass\fB AltIsNotMeta\fP)"
If \*(``true\*('', treat the Alt-key as if it were the Meta-key.
Your keyboard may happen to be configured so they are the same.
But if they are not, this allows you to use the same prefix- and shifting
operations with the Alt-key as with the Meta-key.
See \fBaltSendsEscape\fP and \fBmetaSendsEscape\fP.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "altSendsEscape (\fPclass\fB AltSendsEscape\fP)"
This is an additional keyboard operation that may be processed
after the logic for \fBmetaSendsEscape\fP.
It is only available if the \fBaltIsNotMeta\fP resource is set.
.RS
.bP
If \*(``true\*('', Alt characters

This applies as well to function key control sequences, unless \fI\*n\fP
sees that \fBAlt\fP is used in your key translations.
.bP
If \*(``false\*('', Alt characters input from the keyboard cause a shift to
8-bit characters (just like \fBmetaSendsEscape\fP).
By combining the Alt- and Meta-modifiers, you can create corresponding
combinations of ESC-prefix and 8-bit characters.

.B "alwaysBoldMode (\fPclass\fB AlwaysBoldMode)"
Specifies whether \fI\*n\fP should check if the normal and bold
fonts are distinct before deciding whether to use overstriking to
simulate bold fonts.

This resource is used only for bitmap fonts:
.bP
When using bitmap fonts, it is possible that the font server will
approximate the bold font by rescaling it from
a different font size than expected.
The \fBalwaysBoldMode\fP resource
allows the user to override the (sometimes poor)
resulting bold font with overstriking (which is at least consistent).
.bP
The problem does not occur with TrueType fonts (though there can be
other unnecessary issues such as different coverage of the normal
and bold fonts).
.RE
.IP
As an alternative, setting the \fBallowBoldFonts\fP resource to false
overrides both the \fBalwaysBoldMode\fP and the \fBboldMode\fP resources.
.TP 8
.B "alwaysHighlight (\fPclass\fB AlwaysHighlight)"
Specifies whether or not \fI\*n\fP should always display a highlighted
text cursor.
By default (if this resource is false),
a hollow text cursor is displayed whenever the
pointer moves out of the window or the window loses the input focus.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "alwaysUseMods (\fPclass\fB AlwaysUseMods)"
Override the \fBnumLock\fP resource, telling \fI\*n\fR to use the Alt and Meta
modifiers to construct parameters for function key sequences even if
those modifiers appear in the translations resource.
Normally \fI\*n\fP checks if Alt or Meta is used in a translation that
would conflict with function key modifiers, and will ignore these modifiers
in that special case.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "answerbackString (\fPclass\fB AnswerbackString)"
Specifies the string that \fI\*n\fR sends in response to an ENQ (control/E)
character from the host.
The default is a blank string, i.e., \*(``\*(''.
A hardware VT100 implements this feature as a setup option.
.TP 8
.B "appcursorDefault (\fPclass\fB AppcursorDefault)"
If \*(``true\*('', the cursor keys are initially in application mode.

This is the same as the VT102 DECAWM.
The
default is \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "awaitInput (\fPclass\fB AwaitInput)"
Specifies whether or not the \fI\*n\fR uses a 50 millisecond timeout to
await input (i.e., to support the Xaw3d arrow scrollbar).
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "backarrowKey (\fPclass\fB BackarrowKey)"
Specifies whether the backarrow key transmits
a backspace (8)
or delete (127) character.
This corresponds to the DECBKM control sequence.
A \*(``true\*('' value specifies backspace.
The default is \*(``__backarrow_key_is_del__\*(''.
Pressing the control key toggles this behavior.

Specifies whether to set the Urgency hint for the window manager
when making a bell sound.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.

.B "bellOnReset (\fPclass\fB BellOnReset)"
Specifies whether to sound a bell when doing a hard reset.
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "bellSuppressTime (\fPclass\fB BellSuppressTime)"
Number of milliseconds after a bell command is sent during which additional
bells will be suppressed.
Default is 200.
If set non-zero,
additional bells
will also be suppressed until the server reports that processing of
the first bell has been completed; this feature is most useful with
the visible bell.
.TP 8
.B "boldColors (\fPclass\fB ColorMode)"
Specifies whether to combine bold attribute with colors like the IBM PC,
i.e., map colors 0 through 7 to colors 8 through 15.
These normally are the brighter versions of the first 8 colors, hence bold.
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "boldFont (\fPclass\fB BoldFont)"
Specifies the name of the bold font to use instead of overstriking.
There is no default for this resource.
.IP
This font must be the same height and width as the normal font, otherwise it is ignored.
If only one of the normal or bold fonts is specified, it will be used as the
normal font and the bold font will be produced by overstriking this font.
.IP
See also the discussion of \fBboldMode\fP and \fBalwaysBoldMode\fP resources.
.TP 8
.B "boldMode (\fPclass\fB BoldMode)"
This specifies whether or not text with the bold attribute should be
overstruck to simulate bold fonts if the resolved bold font is the
same as the normal font.
It may be desirable to disable bold fonts when color is being
used for the bold attribute.
.IP
Note that \fI\*n\fP has one bold font which you may set explicitly.
\fI\*N\fP attempts to derive a bold font for the other font selections
(\fBfont1\fP through \fBfont6\fP).
If it cannot find a bold font, it will use the normal font.
In each case (whether the explicit resource or the derived font),
if the normal and bold fonts are distinct, this resource has no effect.
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.IP
See the \fBalwaysBoldMode\fP resource which can modify the behavior
of this resource.
.IP
Although \fI\*n\fP attempts to derive a bold font for other font selections,
the font server may not cooperate.
Since X11R6, bitmap fonts have been scaled.
The font server claims to provide the bold font that \fI\*n\fP requests,
but the result is not always readable.
XFree86 introduced a feature which can be used to suppress the scaling.
In the X server's configuration file (e.g., \*(``/etc/X11/XFree86\*(''), you
can add \*(``:unscaled\*('' to the end of the directory specification for the
\*(``misc\*('' fonts,
which comprise the fixed-pitch fonts that are used by \fI\*n\fP.
For example
.NS
FontPath	"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/"
.NE
would become
.NS
FontPath	"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/:unscaled"
.NE
Depending on your configuration, the font server may have its own configuration
file.
The same \*(``:unscaled\*('' can be added to its configuration file at the
end of the directory specification for \*(``misc\*(''.

.TP 8
.B "brokenSelections (\fPclass\fB BrokenSelections)"
If true, \fI\*n\fP in 8-bit mode will interpret
.B STRING
selections as carrying text in the current locale's encoding.
Normally
.B STRING
selections carry ISO-8859-1 encoded text.
Setting this resource to

Ordinary control characters found within the string are not ignored;
they are processed without interfering with the process of accumulating
the control string's content.
\fI\*N\fP recognizes these controls in all modes,

When turned on, characters with East Asian Ambiguous (A) category in UTR
11 have a column width of 2.
You may have to set this option to \*(``true\*(''

The default resource values
are for colors 16 through 231 to make a 6x6x6 color cube, and colors
232 through 255 to make a grayscale ramp.
.IP
Resources past \fBcolor15\fP are available as a compile-time option.
Due to a hardcoded limit in the X libraries on the total number of
resources (to 400), the resources for 256-colors
are omitted when wide-character support and \fIluit\fP are enabled.
Besides inconsistent behavior if only part of the resources were allowed,
determining the exact cutoff is difficult, and the X libraries tend
to crash if the number of resources exceeds the limit.
The color palette is still initialized to the same default values,
and can be modified via control sequences.
.IP
On the other hand, the resource limit does permit including the entire

In VT220 keyboard mode (see \fBsunKeyboard\fP resource),
specifies the amount by which to shift F1-F12 given a control modifier (CTRL).
This allows you to generate key symbols for F10-F20 on a Sun/PC keyboard.

.B "cursorBlink (\fPclass\fB CursorBlink)"
Specifies whether to make the cursor blink.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.IP
\fI\*N\fP uses two variables to determine whether the cursor blinks.
One is set by this resource.
The other is set by control sequences (private mode 12 and DECSCUSR).
\fI\*N\fP tests the XOR of the two variables.
.TP 8
.B "cursorColor (\fPclass\fB CursorColor)"
Specifies the color to use for the text cursor.
The default is \*(``XtDefaultForeground\*(''.
By default,
\fI\*n\fP attempts to keep this color from being the same as the background
color, since it draws the cursor by filling the background of a text cell.
The same restriction applies to control sequences which may change this color.

.TP 8
.B "defaultString (\fPclass\fB DefaultString)"
Specify the character (or string) which \fI\*n\fP will substitute when
pasted text includes a character which cannot be represented in the
current encoding.
For instance, pasting UTF-8 text into a display of ISO-8859-1 characters
will only be able to display codes 0-255, while UTF-8 text can include
Unicode values above 255.
The default is \*(``#\*('' (a single pound sign).
.IP
If the undisplayable text would be double-width,
\fI\*n\fP will add a space after the \*(``#\*('' character, to give roughly
the same layout on the screen as the original text.
.TP 8
.B "deleteIsDEL (\fPclass\fB DeleteIsDEL)"

If \*(``true\*('', Meta characters
(a single-byte character combined with the \fIMeta\fP modifier key)
input from the keyboard are presented as a
single character, modified according to the \fBeightBitMeta\fP resource.
If \*(``false\*('', Meta characters are converted into a two-character
sequence with the character itself preceded by ESC.
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.IP
The \fBmetaSendsEscape\fP
and \fBaltSendsEscape\fP resources may override this feature.
Generally keyboards do not have a key labeled \*(``Meta\*('',
but \*(``Alt\*('' keys are common,
and they are conventionally used for \*(``Meta\*(''.
If they were synonymous, it would have been reasonable to name this
resource \*(``\fBaltSendsEscape\fP\*('', reversing its sense.
For more background on this, see the \fBmeta\fP function in curses.
.IP
Note that the \fIAlt\fP key is not necessarily the same as the
\fIMeta\fP modifier.
\fIxmodmap\fP lists your key modifiers.
X defines modifiers for shift, (caps) lock and control,
as well as 5 additional modifiers which are generally used to configure
key modifiers.
\fI\*n\fP inspects the same information to find the modifier associated
with either \fIMeta\fP key (left or right),
and uses that key as the \fIMeta\fP modifier.
It also looks for the NumLock key,
to recognize the modifier which is associated with that.
.IP
If your \fIxmodmap\fP configuration
uses the same keycodes for Alt- and Meta-keys,
\fI\*n\fP will only see the Alt-key definitions, since those are tested
before Meta-keys.
NumLock is tested first.
It is important to keep these keys distinct;
otherwise some of \fI\*n\fP's functionality is not available.
.IP
The \fBeightBitInput\fP resource is tested at startup time.
If \*(``true\*('',
the \fI\*n\fP tries to put the terminal into 8-bit mode.
If \*(``false\*('',
on startup, \fI\*n\fP tries to put the terminal into 7-bit mode.
For some configurations this is unsuccessful; failure is ignored.
After startup, \fI\*n\fP does not
change the terminal between 8-bit and 7-bit mode.
.IP
As originally implemented in X11,
the resource value did not change after startup.
However
(since patch #216 in 2006)
\fI\*n\fP can modify \fBeightBitInput\fP after startup
via a control sequence.
The corresponding terminfo capabilities \fBsmm\fP (set meta mode)
and \fBrmm\fP (reset meta mode)
have been recognized by \fIbash\fP for some time.
Interestingly enough, \fIbash\fP's notion of "meta mode"
differs from the standard definition (in the \fIterminfo\fP manual),
which describes the change to the eighth bit of a character.
It happens that \fIbash\fP views "meta mode"
as the ESC character that \fI\*n\fP puts before a character when a
special meta key is pressed.
\fIbash\fP's early documentation talks about the ESC character
and ignores the eighth bit.
.TP 8
.B "eightBitMeta (\fPclass\fB EightBitMeta\fP)"
This controls the way \fI\*n\fP modifies the eighth bit of a single-byte
key when the \fBeightBitInput\fP resource is set.

.B "faceName (\fPclass\fB FaceName)"
Specify the pattern for scalable fonts selected from the FreeType
library if support for that library was compiled into \fI\*n\fR.
There is no default value.
.IP
If not specified,
or if there is no match for both normal and bold fonts,
\fI\*n\fR uses the bitmap \fBfont\fP and related resources.
.IP
It is possible to select suitable bitmap fonts using a script such as this:
.NS
\&#!/bin/sh
\&FONT=`xfontsel -print`
\&test -n "$FONT" && xfd -fn "$FONT"
.NE
However (even though \fIxfd\fP accepts a \*(``\fB\-fa\fP\*('' option
to denote FreeType fonts),
\fIxfontsel\fP has not been similarly extended.
As a workaround, you may try
.NS
fc-list :scalable=true:spacing=mono: family
.NE
to find a list of scalable fixed-pitch fonts
which may be used for the \fBfaceName\fP resource value.
.TP 8
.B "faceNameDoublesize (\fPclass\fB FaceNameDoublesize)"
Specify a double-width scalable font for cases where an application requires
this, e.g., in CJK applications.
There is no default value.
.IP
If the application uses double-wide characters and this resource is not given,
\fI\*n\fP will use a scaled version of the font given by \fBfaceName\fP.
.TP 8
.B "faceSize (\fPclass\fB FaceSize)"
Specify the pointsize for fonts selected from the FreeType
library if support for that library was compiled into \fI\*n\fR.
The default is \*(``14.0\*(''
On the \fBVT\ Fonts\fP menu, this corresponds to the \fIDefault\fP entry.
.IP
Although the default is \*(``14.0\*('',
this may not be the same as the pointsize for the default bitmap font,
i.e., that assigned with the \fB\-fn\fP option,
or the \fBfont\fP resource.
For example, the \*(``fixed\*('' font usually has a pointsize of \*(``8.0\*(''.
If you set \fBfaceSize\fP to match the size of the bitmap font,
then switching between bitmap and TrueType fonts via the font menu
will give comparable sizes for the window.
.IP
You can specify the pointsize for TrueType fonts selected with the other
size-related menu entries such as Medium, Huge, etc., by using one of
the following resource values.
If you do not specify a value,
they default to \*(``0.0\*('',
which causes \fI\*n\fP to use the ratio of font sizes
from the corresponding bitmap
font resources to obtain a TrueType pointsize.
.IP
If all of the \fBfaceSize\fP resources are set, then \fI\*n\fP
will use this information to determine the next smaller/larger
TrueType font for the
\fBlarger-vt-font()\fP and
\fBsmaller-vt-font()\fP actions.
If any are not set, \fI\*n\fP will use only the areas of the bitmap fonts.

Depending on the way your applications write to the screen, there may
be trailing blanks on a line.
\fI\*N\fP stores data as it is shown on the screen.
Erasing the display changes the internal state of each cell

.I true
\fI\*n\fR will use the
encoding specified by the users' LC_CTYPE locale (i.e., LC_ALL,
LC_CTYPE, or LANG variables) as far as possible.
This is realized
by always enabling UTF-8 mode and invoking \fIluit\fR in non-UTF-8
locales.
.TP

If mini-luit is compiled-in, \fI\*n\fR will check if a Unicode font has
been specified.
If so, it checks if the character encoding for the
current locale is POSIX, Latin-1 or Latin-9, uses the appropriate
mapping to support those with the Unicode font.
For other encodings, \fI\*n\fR assumes that UTF-8 encoding is required.
.TP

\fIluit\fR will be invoked to support the encoding.
The actual list of supported encodings depends on \fIluit\fR.
The default is \*(``medium\*(''.
.IP
Regardless of your locale and encoding,
you need an ISO-10646-1 font to display the result.
Your configuration may not include this font,
or locale-support by \fI\*n\fP may not be needed.
At startup, \fI\*n\fP uses a mechanism equivalent to
the \fBload-vt-fonts(utf8Fonts,\ Utf8Fonts)\fP action
to load font name subresources of the VT100 widget.
That is,
resource patterns such as \*(``\fB*vt100.utf8Fonts.font\fP\*('' will be loaded,
and (if this resource is enabled), override the normal fonts.
If no subresources are found,
the normal fonts such as \*(``\fB*vt100.font\fP\*('', etc., are used.
The resource files distributed with \fI\*n\fP use ISO-10646-1 fonts,
but do not rely on them unless you are using the locale mechanism.
.TP 8
.B "localeFilter (\fPclass\fB LocaleFilter)"
Specifies the file name for the encoding converter from/to locale
encodings and UTF-8 which is used with the \fB\-lc\fR option or \fBlocale\fR resource.
The help message shown by \*(``\*n \-help\*('' lists the default value,
which depends on your system configuration.
.IP
If the encoding converter requires command-line parameters,
you can add those after the command, e.g.,
.NS
*localeFilter: xterm-filter -p
.NE
Alternatively,
you may put those parameter within a shell script to execute the converter,
and set this resource to point to the shell script.

.TP 8
.B "mkSamplePass (\fPclass\fB MkSamplePass)"
If \fBmkSampleSize\fP is nonzero,
and \fBmkWidth\fP (and \fBcjkWidth\fP) are false,
on startup \fI\*n\fP compares its built-in tables to the system's
wide character width data to decide if it will use the system's data.
It tests the first \fBmkSampleSize\fP character values,
and allows up to \fBmkSamplePass\fP mismatches before the test fails.
The default (for the allowed number of mismatches) is 256.
.TP 8
.B "mkSampleSize (\fPclass\fB MkSampleSize)"
With \fBmkSamplePass\fP, this specifies a startup test used for
initializing wide character width calculations.

.B "resizeGravity (\fPclass\fB ResizeGravity)"
Affects the behavior when the window is resized to be taller or
shorter.
\fBNorthWest\fP
specifies that the top line of text on the screen stay fixed.
If the window
is made shorter, lines are dropped from the bottom; if the window is
made taller, blank lines are added at the bottom.
This is compatible
with the behavior in R4.
\fBSouthWest\fP (the default) specifies that
the bottom line of text on the screen stay fixed.
If the window is
made taller, additional saved lines will be scrolled down onto the
screen; if the window is made shorter, lines will be scrolled off the
top of the screen, and the top saved lines will be dropped.
.TP 8
.B "retryInputMethod (\fPclass\fB XtCRetryInputMethod)"
Tells \fI\*n\fP how many times to retry,
in case the input-method server is not responding.
This is a different issue than unsupported preedit type, etc.
You may encounter retries if your X configuration (and its libraries)
are missing pieces.
Setting this resource to zero ``0'' will cancel the retrying.
The default is ``3''.
.TP 8
.B "reverseVideo (\fPclass\fB ReverseVideo)"
Specifies whether or not reverse video should be simulated.
The default is
\*(``false\*(''.
.IP
There are several aspects to reverse video in \fI\*n\fP:
.RS
.bP
The command-line \fB\-rv\fP option tells the X libraries to reverse
the foreground and background colors.
\fI\*N\fP's command-line options set resource values.
In particular, the X Toolkit sets the \fBreverseVideo\fP resource
when the \fB\-rv\fP option is used.
.bP
If the user has also used command-line options \fB\-fg\fP or \fB\-bg\fP
to set the foreground and background colors,
\fI\*n\fP does not see these options directly.
Instead,
it examines the resource values to reconstruct the command-line options,
and determine which of the colors is the user's intended foreground, etc.
Their actual values are irrelevant to the reverse video function;
some users prefer the X defaults (black text on a white background),
others prefer white text on a black background.
.bP
After startup,
the user can toggle the \*(``Enable Reverse Video\*('' menu entry.
This exchanges the current foreground and background colors
of the VT100 widget,
and repaints the screen.
Because of the X resource hierarchy,
the \fBreverseVideo\fP resource applies to more than the VT100 widget.
.RE
.IP
Programs running in an \fI\*n\fP can also use control sequences
to enable the VT100 reverse video mode.
These are independent of the \fIreverseVideo\fP resource and the menu entry.
\fI\*N\fP exchanges the current foreground and background colors
when drawing text affected by these control sequences.
.IP
Other control sequences can alter the foreground and background colors
which are used:
.RS
.bP
Programs can also use the ANSI color control sequences to set the
foreground and background colors.
.bP
Extensions to the ANSI color controls (such as 16-, 88- or 256-colors)
are treated similarly to the ANSI control.
.bP
Using other control sequences (the \*(``\fIdynamic colors\fR\*('' feature),
a program can change the foreground and background colors.

Modifying the scrollbar's border affects only the line between the VT100
widget and the scrollbar.
The default value is 1.
.TP 8
.B "scrollKey (\fPclass\fB ScrollCond)"
Specifies whether or not pressing a key should automatically cause the
scrollbar to go to the bottom of the scrolling region.
This corresponds to \fI\*n\fP's private mode 1011.

Specifies whether \fI\*n\fP should scroll to a new page when processing
the \fIti\fP termcap entry, i.e., the private modes 47, 1047 or 1049.
This is only in effect if \fBtiteInhibit\fP is \*(``true\*('',

termcap entries (used to switch between alternate screens on startup of many
screen-oriented programs) from the TERMCAP string.
If set,
\fI\*n\fP also ignores the escape sequence to switch to the
alternate screen.
\fI\*N\fP supports terminfo in a different way, supporting composite control

.B "trimSelection (\fPclass\fB TrimSelection)"
If you set \fBhighlightSelection\fP,
you can see the text which is selected, including any trailing spaces.
Clearing the screen (or a line) resets it to a state containing no spaces.
Some lines may contain trailing spaces when an application writes them to
the screen.
However, you may not wish to paste lines with trailing spaces.
If this resource is true, \fI\*n\fP will trim trailing spaces from
text which is selected.
It does not affect spaces which result in a wrapped line, nor will it
trim the trailing newline from your selection.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.

Originally used to work around for overstriking effects,
this is also needed to work with some incorrectly-sized fonts.
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "utf8 (\fPclass\fB Utf8)"
This specifies whether \fI\*n\fP will run in UTF-8 mode.
If you set this resource, \fI\*n\fP also sets the \fBwideChars\fP resource as a side-effect.
The resource can be set via the menu entry \*(``UTF-8 Encoding\*(''.

.B "utf8Title (\fPclass\fB Utf8Title)"
Applications can set \fI\*n\fP's title by writing a control sequence.
Normally this control sequence follows the VT220 convention,
which encodes the string in ISO-8859-1 and
allows for an 8-bit string terminator.
If \fI\*n\fP is started in a UTF-8 locale,
it translates the ISO-8859-1 string to UTF-8 to work with the X libraries
which assume the string is UTF-8.
.IP
However, some users may wish to write a title string encoded in UTF-8.
The window manager is responsible for drawing window titles.
Some window managers (not all) support UTF-8 encoding of window titles.
Set this resource to \*(``true\*('' to allow UTF-8 encoded title strings.
That cancels the translation to UTF-8,
allowing UTF-8 strings to be displayed as is.

This feature is available as a menu entry, since it is related to
the particular applications you are running within \fI\*n\fP.
You can also use a control sequence

.SS Scrollbar Resources
.PP
The following resources are useful when specified for the Athena Scrollbar
widget:
.TP 8
.B "thickness (\fPclass\fB Thickness)"
Specifies the width in pixels of the scrollbar.
.TP 8
.B "background (\fPclass\fB Background)"
Specifies the color to use for the background of the scrollbar.
.TP 8
.B "foreground (\fPclass\fB Foreground)"
Specifies the color to use for the foreground of the scrollbar.
The \*(``thumb\*(''
of the scrollbar is a simple checkerboard pattern alternating pixels for
foreground and background color.
.
.
.SH "POINTER USAGE"
.
.PP
Once the VT102 window is created,
.I \*n
allows you to select text and copy it within the same or other windows.
.
.SS "SELECTION"
.PP
The selection functions are invoked when the pointer buttons are used with no
modifiers, and when they are used with the \*(``shift\*('' key.
The assignment of the functions described below to keys and buttons may
be changed through the resource database; see \fBACTIONS\fP below.
.
.PP
Pointer button one (usually left) is used to save text into the cut buffer.
Move the cursor to beginning of the text,
and then hold the button down while moving the cursor to the end of the region
and releasing the button.
The selected text is highlighted and is saved in the global cut buffer
and made the PRIMARY selection when the button is released.
Normally (but see the discussion of \fBon2Clicks\fP, etc):
.RS
.bP
Double-clicking selects by words.
.bP
Triple-clicking
selects by lines.
.bP
Quadruple-clicking goes back to characters, etc.
.RE
.PP
Multiple-click is determined by the time from button up to
button down, so you can change the selection unit in the middle of a selection.
Logical words and lines selected by double- or triple-clicking may wrap
across more than one screen line if lines were wrapped by \fI\*n\fP
itself rather than by the application running in the window.
If the key/button bindings specify that an X selection is to be made,
\fI\*n\fP will leave the selected text highlighted for as long as it
is the selection owner.
.
.PP
Pointer button two (usually middle) \*(``types\*('' (pastes) the text from
the PRIMARY selection, if any, otherwise from
the cut buffer,
inserting it as keyboard input.
.
.PP
Pointer button three (usually right) extends the current selection.
(Without loss of generality,
you can swap \*(``right\*('' and \*(``left\*('' everywhere in the rest of this
paragraph.)  If pressed while closer to
the right edge of the selection than the left, it extends/contracts the
right edge of the selection.
If you contract the selection past
the left edge of the selection,
.I \*n
assumes you really meant the left edge, restores the original selection, then
extends/contracts the left edge of the selection.
Extension starts in the
selection unit mode
that the last selection or extension was performed in; you can multiple-click
to cycle through them.
.
.PP
By cutting and pasting pieces of text without trailing new lines,
you can take text from several places in different windows and form a command
to the shell, for example, or take output from a program and insert it into
your favorite editor.
Since cut buffers are globally shared among different applications,
you may regard each as a \*(``file\*('' whose contents you know.
The terminal emulator and other text programs should be treating it as if it
were a text file, i.e., the text is delimited by new lines.
.
.SS "SCROLLING"
.PP
The scroll region displays the position and amount of text currently showing
in the window (highlighted) relative to the amount of text actually saved.
As more text is saved (up to the maximum), the size of the highlighted area
decreases.
.
.PP
Clicking button one with the pointer in the scroll region moves the
adjacent line to the top of the display window.
.
.PP
Clicking button three moves the top line of the display window down to the
pointer position.
.
.PP
Clicking button two moves the display to a position in the saved text
that corresponds to the pointer's position in the scrollbar.
.
.SS "TEKTRONIX POINTER"
.PP
Unlike the VT102 window, the Tektronix window does not allow the copying of
text.
It does allow Tektronix GIN mode, and in this mode
the cursor will change from an arrow to a cross.
Pressing any key will send that key and the current coordinate of the
cross cursor.
Pressing button one, two, or three will return the letters \*(``l\*('', \*(``m\*('', and
\*(``r\*('', respectively.
If the \*(``shift\*('' key is pressed when a pointer button is pressed, the corresponding
upper case letter is sent.
To distinguish a pointer button from a key, the high bit of the character is
set (but this is bit is normally stripped unless the terminal mode is RAW;
see
.IR tty (4)
for details).
.
.
.SH SELECT/PASTE
X clients provide select and paste support by responding to requests conveyed
by the server.
.SS PRIMARY
When configured to use the primary selection,
(the default) \fI\*n\fP can
provide the selection data in ways which help to retain character
encoding information as it is pasted.
.PP
A user \*(``selects\*('' text on \*n, which highlights the selected text.
A subsequent \*(``paste\*('' to another client forwards a request to the client owning
the selection.
If \fI\*n\fP owns the primary selection, it makes the data
available in the form of one or more \*(``selection targets\*(''.
If it does not own the primary selection,
e.g., if it has released it or another client has
asserted ownership, it relies on cut-buffers to pass the data.
But cut-buffers handle only ISO-8859-1 data
(officially \- some clients ignore the rules).
.
.SS CLIPBOARD
When configured to use the clipboard (see resource \fBselectToClipboard\fP),
the problem with persistence of ownership is bypassed.
Otherwise, there is no difference regarding the data which can be
passed via selection.
.
.SS SELECTION TARGETS
The different types of data which are passed depend on what the receiving
client asks for.
These are termed \fIselection targets\fP.
.PP
When asking for the selection data,
\fI\*n\fP tries the following types in this order:
.RS
.TP 5
UTF8_STRING
This is an XFree86 extension, which denotes that the data is encoded in UTF-8.
When \fI\*n\fP is built with wide-character support,
it both accepts and provides this type.
.TP 5
TEXT
the text is in the encoding which corresponds to your current locale.
.TP 5
.\" see xc/doc/specs/CTEXT/ctext.tbl.ms
.\" (it says the data is stored as a type of ISO 2022)
COMPOUND_TEXT
this is a format for multiple character set data, such as multi-lingual text.
It can store UTF-8 data as a special case.
.TP 5
STRING
This is Latin 1 (ISO-8859-1) data.
.RE
.PP
The middle two (TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT) are added if \fI\*n\fP
is configured with the \fBi18nSelections\fP resource set to \*(``true\*(''.
.PP
UTF8_STRING is preferred (therefore first in the list)
since \fI\*n\fP stores text as Unicode data when
running in wide-character mode, and no translation is needed.
On the other hand, TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT may require translation.
If the translation is incomplete, they will insert X's \*(``defaultString\*(''
whose value cannot be set, and may simply be empty.
\fI\*N\fP's \fBdefaultString\fP resource specifies the string to
use for incomplete translations of the UTF8_STRING.
.PP
You can alter the types which \fI\*n\fP tries using the
\fBeightBitSelectTypes\fP or \fButf8SelectTypes\fP resources.
For instance, you might have some specific locale setting
which does not use UTF-8 encoding.
The resource value is a comma-separated list of the selection targets,
which consist of the names shown.
You can use the special name I18N
to denote the optional inclusion of TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT.
The names are matched ignoring case, and can be abbreviated.
The default list can be expressed in several ways, e.g.,
.sp
.RS
.nf
UTF8_STRING,I18N,STRING
utf8,i18n,string
u,i,s

.SH MENUS

sending the text of the current window directly to a file,
as specified by the
\fBprintFileImmediate\fP,
\fBprintModeImmediate\fP and
\fBprintOptsImmediate\fP
resources.
.TP
Print-All on Error
Invokes the \fBprint-on-error\fP action,
which toggles a flag telling \fI\*n\fP that if it exits with an X error,
to send the text of the current window directly to a file,
as specified by the
\fBprintFileXError\fP,
\fBprintModeXError\fP and
\fBprintOptsXError\fP
resources.
.TP
Print Window (print)
Sends the text of the current window to the program given in the

.TP
Redirect to Printer (print-redir)
This sets the \fBprinterControlMode\fR to 0 or 2.
You can use this to turn the printer on as if an application had sent
the appropriate control sequence.
It is also useful for switching the printer
off if an application turns it on without resetting the print control mode.
.RE
.TP
Modes for setting keyboard style:
.RS
.TP
8-Bit Controls (8-bit-control)
Enabled for VT220 emulation, this controls whether \fI\*n\fP will send
8-bit control sequences rather than using 7-bit (ASCII) controls,
e.g., sending a byte in the range 128-159 rather than the escape character
followed by a second byte.
\fI\*N\fP always interprets both 8-bit and 7-bit control sequences
(see the document \fIXterm Control Sequences\fP).
This corresponds to the \fBeightBitControl\fP resource.
.TP
Backarrow Key (BS/DEL) (backarrow\ key)
Modifies the behavior of the backarrow key, making it transmit
either a backspace (8)
or delete (127) character.
This corresponds to the \fBbackarrowKey\fP resource.
.TP
Alt/NumLock Modifiers (num-lock)
Controls the treatment of Alt- and NumLock-key modifiers.
This corresponds to the \fBnumLock\fP resource.
.TP
Meta Sends Escape (meta-esc)
Controls whether \fIMeta\fP keys are converted into a two-character
sequence with the character itself preceded by ESC.
This corresponds to the \fBmetaSendsEscape\fP resource.
.TP
Delete is DEL (delete-is-del)
Controls whether the Delete key on the editing keypad should send DEL (127)

Initially the checkmark is set according to both the \fButf8\fP

.SH SECURITY
.
.PP
X environments differ in their security consciousness.
.bP
Most servers,
run under \fIxdm\fP,
are capable of using a \*(``magic cookie\*('' authorization
scheme that can provide a reasonable level of security for many people.
If your server is only using a host-based mechanism to control access to
the server (see \fIxhost(__mansuffix__)\fP), then if you enable access for a host and
other users are also permitted to run clients on that same host,
it is possible that someone can run an application which uses the
basic services of the X protocol to snoop on your activities,
potentially capturing a transcript of everything you type at the keyboard.
.bP
Any process which has access to your X display can manipulate it
in ways that you might not anticipate,
even redirecting your keyboard to itself
and sending events to your application's windows.
This is true even with the \*(``magic cookie\*('' authorization scheme.
While the \fBallowSendEvents\fP provides some protection against
rogue applications tampering with your programs,
guarding against a snooper is harder.
.
.bP
The X input extension for instance allows an application to bypass
all of the other (limited) authorization and security features,
including the GrabKeyboard protocol.
.
.bP
The possibility of an application spying on your keystrokes
is of particular concern when you want to type in a password
or other sensitive data.
The best solution to this problem is to use a better
authorization mechanism than is provided by X.
.PP
Subject to all of these caveats,
a simple mechanism exists for protecting keyboard input in \fI\*n\fP.
.
.PP
The \fI\*n\fP menu (see \fBMENUS\fP above) contains a \fBSecure Keyboard\fP
entry which, when enabled,
attempts to ensure that all keyboard input is directed
\fIonly\fP to \fI\*n\fP (using the GrabKeyboard protocol request).
When an application prompts you for a password
(or other sensitive data), you can enable \fBSecure Keyboard\fP using the
menu, type in the data, and then disable \fBSecure Keyboard\fP using
the menu again.
.bP
This ensures that you know which window is accepting your keystrokes.
.bP
It cannot ensure that there are no processes which have access to your
X display that might be observing the keystrokes as well.
.
.PP
Only one X client at a time can grab the keyboard,
so when you attempt to enable \fBSecure Keyboard\fP it may fail.
In this case, the bell will sound.
If the \fBSecure Keyboard\fP succeeds,
the foreground and background colors will be exchanged (as if you
selected the \fBReverse Video\fP entry in the \fBModes\fP menu);
they will be exchanged again when you exit secure mode.
If the colors
do \fInot\fP switch, then
you should be \fIvery\fP suspicious that you are being spoofed.
If the application you are running displays a prompt before asking for
the password, it is safest to enter secure mode \fIbefore\fP the
prompt gets displayed, and to make sure that the prompt gets displayed
correctly (in the new colors), to minimize the probability of
spoofing.
You can also bring up the menu again and make sure that a check
mark appears next to the entry.
.
.PP
\fBSecure Keyboard\fP mode will be disabled automatically if your \fI\*n\fP
window becomes iconified (or otherwise unmapped), or if you start up
a reparenting window manager (that places a title bar or other decoration
around the window) while in \fBSecure Keyboard\fP mode.
(This is a
feature of the X protocol not easily overcome.)  When this happens,
the foreground and background colors will be switched back and the bell
will sound in warning.
.
.
.SH "CHARACTER CLASSES"
Clicking the left pointer button twice in rapid succession
(double-clicking) causes all characters of the same class
(e.g., letters, white space, punctuation) to be selected as a \*(``word\*(''.
Since different people have different preferences for what should
be selected (for example, should filenames be selected as a whole or only
the separate subnames), the default mapping can be overridden through the use
of the \fBcharClass\fP (class \fICharClass\fP) resource.
.
.PP
This resource is a
series of comma-separated
of \fIrange\fP:\fIvalue\fP pairs.
The
\fIrange\fP is either a single number or \fIlow\fP-\fIhigh\fP in the range of 0
to 65535, corresponding to the code for the character or characters to be
set.
The \fIvalue\fP is arbitrary, although the default table uses the
character number of the first character occurring in the set.
When not in
UTF-8 mode, only the first 256 bytes of this table will be used.
.
.PP
The default table starts as follows \-

.SH ACTIONS
It is possible to rebind keys (or sequences of keys) to arbitrary strings
for input, by changing the \fBtranslations\fP resources
for the vt100 or tek4014 widgets.
Changing the \fBtranslations\fP resource
for events other than key and button events is not expected,
and will cause unpredictable behavior.
The following
actions are provided for use within the \fIvt100\fP or \fItek4014\fP
\fBtranslations\fP resources:
.TP 8
.B "allow-color-ops(\fIon/off/toggle\fP)"
This action sets, unsets or toggles the \fBallowColorOps\fP resource and is also
invoked by the \fBallow-color-ops\fP entry in \fIfontMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "allow-font-ops(\fIon/off/toggle\fP)"
This action sets, unsets or toggles the \fBallowFontOps\fP resource and is also
invoked by the \fBallow-font-ops\fP entry in \fIfontMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "allow-send-events(\fIon/off/toggle\fP)"
This action sets, unsets or toggles the \fBallowSendEvents\fP resource and is also
invoked by the \fBallowsends\fP entry in \fImainMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "allow-tcap-ops(\fIon/off/toggle\fP)"
This action sets, unsets or toggles the \fBallowTcapOps\fP resource and is also
invoked by the \fBallow-tcap-ops\fP entry in \fIfontMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "allow-title-ops(\fIon/off/toggle\fP)"
This action sets, unsets or toggles the \fBallowTitleOps\fP resource and is also
invoked by the \fBallow-title-ops\fP entry in \fIfontMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "allow-window-ops(\fIon/off/toggle\fP)"
This action sets, unsets or toggles the \fBallowWindowOps\fP resource and is also
invoked by the \fBallow-window-ops\fP entry in \fIfontMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "alt-sends-escape()"
This action toggles the state of the \fBaltSendsEscape\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "bell([\fIpercent\fP])"
This action rings the keyboard bell at the specified percentage
above or below the base volume.
.TP 8
.B "clear-saved-lines()"
This action does \fBhard-reset()\fP (see below) and also clears the history
of lines saved off the top of the screen.
It is also invoked from the \fBclearsavedlines\fP entry in \fIvtMenu\fP.
The effect is identical to a hardware reset (RIS) control sequence.
.TP 8
.B "copy-selection(\fIdestname\fP [, ...])"
This action puts the currently selected text into all of the selections or
cutbuffers specified by \fIdestname\fP.
Unlike \fBselect-end\fP, it does not send a mouse position or otherwise
modify the internal selection state.
.TP 8
.B "create-menu(\fIm/v/f/t\fP)"
This action creates one of the menus used by \fI\*n\fP,
if it has not been previously created.
The parameter values are the menu names:
\fImainMenu\fP, \fIvtMenu\fP, \fIfontMenu\fP, \fItekMenu\fP, respectively.
.TP 8
.B "dabbrev-expand()"
Expands the word before cursor by searching in the preceding text on the
screen and in the scrollback buffer for words starting with that
abbreviation.
Repeating \fBdabbrev-expand()\fP several times in sequence searches for an
alternative expansion by looking farther back.
Lack of more matches is signaled by a \fBbeep()\fP.
Attempts to expand an empty word
(i.e., when cursor is preceded by a space) yield successively all previous
words.
Consecutive identical expansions are ignored.
The word here is defined as a sequence of non-whitespace characters.
This feature partially emulates the behavior
of \*(``dynamic abbreviation\*('' expansion in Emacs (bound there to M\-/).
Here is a resource setting for \fI\*n\fP which will do the same thing:

.TP 8
.B "dired-button()"
Handles a button event (other than press and release)
by echoing the event's position
(i.e., character line and column) in the following format:
.sp
.in +8
^X ESC G <line+\*(`` \*(''> <col+\*(`` \*(''>
.in -8
.TP 8
.B "fullscreen(\fIon/off/toggle\fP)"
This action sets, unsets or toggles the \fBfullscreen\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "iconify()"
Iconifies the window.
.TP 8
.B "hard-reset()"
This action resets the scrolling region, tabs, window size, and cursor keys
and clears the screen.
It is also invoked from the \fBhardreset\fP
entry in \fIvtMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "ignore()"
This action ignores the event but checks for special pointer position
escape sequences.
.TP 8
.B "insert()"
This action inserts the character or string associated with
the key that was pressed.
.TP 8
.B "insert-eight-bit()"
This action inserts an eight-bit (Meta) version of the character or string
associated with the key that was pressed.
Only single-byte values are treated specially.
The exact action depends on the value of
the \fBaltSendsEscape\fP and
the \fBmetaSendsEscape\fP and
the \fBeightBitInput\fP resources.
The \fBmetaSendsEscape\fP resource is tested first.
See the \fBeightBitInput\fP resource for a full discussion.

\fI\*n\fP may then do one of the following:

.B "exec-selectable(\fIformat\fP, \fIonClicks\fP)"
Execute an external command,
using data copied from the screen for part of the command's parameters.
The first parameter, \fIformat\fP gives
the basic command as in \fBexec-formatted\fP.
The second parameter specifies the method for copying
the data as in the \fBonClicks\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "insert-formatted(\fIformat\fP, \fIsourcename\fP [, ...])"
Insert the current selection or data related to it, formatted.
The first parameter, \fIformat\fP gives the template for the data
as in \fBexec-formatted\fP.
Succeeding parameters specify the selection source as in \fBinsert-selection\fP.
.TP 8
.B "insert-selectable(\fIformat\fP, \fIonClicks\fP)"

The first parameter, \fIformat\fP gives the template for the data
as in \fBexec-formatted\fP.
The second parameter specifies the method for copying
the data as in the \fBonClicks\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "insert-selection(\fIsourcename\fP [, ...])"
This action inserts the string found in the selection or cutbuffer indicated
by \fIsourcename\fP.
Sources are checked in the order given (case is
significant) until one is found.
Commonly-used selections include:
\fIPRIMARY\fP, \fISECONDARY\fP, and \fICLIPBOARD\fP.
Cut buffers are
typically named \fICUT_BUFFER0\fP through \fICUT_BUFFER7\fP.
.TP 8
.B "insert-seven-bit()"
This action is a synonym for \fBinsert()\fP
The term \*(``seven-bit\*('' is misleading:
it only implies that \fI\*n\fP does not try to add 128 to the key's value
as in \fBinsert-eight-bit()\fP.
.TP 8
.B "interpret(\fIcontrol-sequence\fP)"
Interpret the given control sequence locally, i.e., without passing it to
the host.
This works by inserting the control sequence at the front
of the input buffer.
Use \*(``\\\*('' to escape octal digits in the string.
Xt does not allow you to put a null character (i.e., \*(``\\000\*('') in the string.
.TP 8
.B "keymap(\fIname\fP)"
This action dynamically defines a new translation table whose resource
name is \fIname\fP with the suffix \fIKeymap\fP (case is significant).
The name \fINone\fP restores the original translation table.
.TP 8
.B "larger-vt-font()"
Set the font to the next larger one, based on the font dimensions.
See also \fBset-vt-font()\fP.
.TP 8
.B "load-vt-fonts(\fIname\fP[,\fIclass\fP])"
Load fontnames from the given subresource name and class.
That is, load the \*(``*VT100.\fIname\fP.font\*('',
resource as \*(``*VT100.font\*('' etc.
If no name is given, the original set of fontnames is restored.
.IP
Unlike \fBset-vt-font()\fR, this does not affect the escape- and select-fonts,
since those are not based on resource values.

Here is an example which uses shifted select/paste to copy to the clipboard,
and unshifted select/paste for the primary selection.
In each case, a (different) cut buffer is
also a target or source of the select/paste operation.
It is important to remember however,
that cut buffers store data in ISO-8859-1 encoding,
while selections can store data in a variety of formats and encodings.
While \fI\*n\fP owns the selection, it highlights it.
When it loses the selection, it removes the corresponding highlight.
But you can still paste from the corresponding cut buffer.
.NS
.ta .5i 1.5i
*VT100*translations:    #override \\n\\\&
    ~Shift~Ctrl<Btn2Up>: insert-selection(PRIMARY, CUT_BUFFER0) \\n\\\&
    Shift~Ctrl<Btn2Up>:  insert-selection(CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER1) \\n\\\&

    Shift<BtnUp>:        select-end(CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER1)

Below is a sample of how the \fBkeymap()\fP action is used to add special
keys for entering commonly-typed works:
.NS
.ta .5i 1.5i
*VT100.Translations: #override <Key>F13: keymap(dbx)
*VT100.dbxKeymap.translations: \\\&
	<Key>F14:	keymap(None) \\n\\\&
	<Key>F17:	string("next") string(0x0d) \\n\\\&
	<Key>F18:	string("step") string(0x0d) \\n\\\&
	<Key>F19:	string("continue") string(0x0d) \\n\\\&
	<Key>F20:	string("print ") insert-selection(PRIMARY, CUT_BUFFER0)
.NE
Some people prefer using the left pointer button
for dragging the scrollbar thumb.
That can be setup by altering the translations resource, e.g.,
.NS
.ta .5i 1.5i
*VT100.scrollbar.translations:	#override \\n\\\&
	<Btn5Down>:	StartScroll(Forward) \\n\\\&
	<Btn1Down>:	StartScroll(Continuous) MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \\n\\\&
	<Btn4Down>:	StartScroll(Backward) \\n\\\&
	<Btn1Motion>:	MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \\n\\\&
	<BtnUp>:	NotifyScroll(Proportional) EndScroll()

.SH "CONTROL SEQUENCES AND KEYBOARD"
The \fIXterm Control Sequences\fP document lists the control sequences which
an application can send \fI\*n\fP to make it perform various operations.
Most of these operations are standardized, from either the DEC or Tektronix
terminals, or from more widely used standards such as ISO-6429.
.
.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.I Xterm
sets several environment variables:
.TP 5
DISPLAY
is the display name,
pointing to the X server (see \fBDISPLAY NAMES\fP in X(__miscmansuffix__)).
.TP 5
TERM
is set according to the termcap (or terminfo) entry which it is using as
a reference.
.TP 5
WINDOWID
is set to the X window id number of the \fI\*n\fP window.
.TP 5
XTERM_LOCALE
shows the locale which was used by \fI\*n\fP on startup.
Some shell initialization scripts may set a different locale.
.TP 5
XTERM_SHELL
is set to the pathname of the program which is invoked.
Usually that is a shell program, e.g., \fI/bin/sh\fP.
Since it is not necessarily a shell program however,
it is distinct from \*(``SHELL\*(''.
.TP 5
XTERM_VERSION
is set to the string displayed by the \fB\-version\fP option.
That is normally an identifier for the X Window libraries used to
build \fI\*n\fP, followed by
\fI\*n\fP's patch number in parenthesis.
The patch number is also part of the response to a Secondary Device Attributes
(DA) control sequence (see \fIXterm Control Sequences\fP).
.
.PP
Depending on your system configuration, \fI\*n\fP may also set the
following:
.TP 5
COLUMNS
the width of the \fI\*n\fP in characters (cf: \*(``stty columns\*('').
.TP 5
HOME
when \fI\*n\fP is configured to update utmp.
.TP 5
LINES
the height of the \fI\*n\fP in characters (cf: \*(``stty rows\*('').
.TP 5
LOGNAME
when \fI\*n\fP is configured to update utmp.
.TP 5
SHELL
when \fI\*n\fP is configured to update utmp.
It is also set if you provide the shell name as the optional parameter.
.TP 5
TERMCAP
the contents of the termcap entry corresponding to $TERM,
with lines and columns values substituted
for the actual size window you have created.
.TP 5
TERMINFO
may be defined to a nonstandard location in the configure script.
.\"
.
.
.SH FILES
The actual pathnames given may differ on your system.
.TP 5
\fI/etc/utmp\fP
the system logfile, which records user logins.
.TP 5
\fI/etc/wtmp\fP
the system logfile, which records user logins and logouts.
.TP 5
.I __apploaddir__/__default_class__
the \fI\*n\fP default application resources.
.TP 5
.I __apploaddir__/__default_class__\-color
the \fI\*n\fP color application resources.
If your display supports color, use this
.in +10
*customization: \-color
.in -10
in your .Xdefaults file to
automatically use this resource file rather than
.IR __apploaddir__/__default_class__ .
If you do not do this,
\fI\*n\fP uses its compiled-in default resource settings for colors.
.
.
.SH ERROR MESSAGES
Most of the fatal error messages from \fI\*n\fP use the following format:
.RS
\*n: Error \fIXXX\fP, errno \fIYYY\fP: \fIZZZ\fP
.RE
The \fIXXX\fP codes (which are used by \fI\*n\fP as its exit-code)
are listed below, with a brief explanation.

.SH BUGS
.
.PP
Large pastes do not work on some systems.
This is not a bug in
\fI\*n\fP; it is a bug in the pseudo terminal driver of those
systems.
\fI\*n\fP feeds large pastes to the pty only as fast as the pty
will accept data, but some pty drivers do not return enough information
to know if the write has succeeded.
.
.PP
When connected to an input method, it is possible for \*n to hang
if the XIM server is suspended or killed.
.
.PP
Many of the options are not resettable after
.I \*n
starts.
.
.PP
This program still needs to be rewritten.
It should be split into very
modular sections, with the various emulators being completely separate
widgets that do not know about each other.
Ideally, you'd like to be able to
pick and choose emulator widgets and stick them into a single control widget.
.
.PP
There needs to be a dialog box to allow entry of the Tek COPY file name.
