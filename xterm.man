.SH NAME
xterm \- terminal emulator for X
.if n .hy 0

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B \*n
[\-\fItoolkitoption\fP \&...\&] [\-\fIoption\fP \&...\&] [\fIshell\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.hy 0
.nh
The \fI\*n\fP program is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.
It provides DEC VT102/VT220 and selected features from higher-level
terminals such as VT320/VT420/VT520 (VT\fIxxx\fP).
It also provides Tektronix 4014 emulation
for programs that cannot use the window system directly.
If the underlying operating system supports
terminal resizing capabilities (for example, the SIGWINCH signal in systems
derived from 4.3BSD), \fI\*n\fP will use the facilities to notify programs
running in the window whenever it is resized.
.
.PP
The VT\fIxxx\fP and Tektronix 4014 terminals each have their own window
so that you can edit text in one and
look at graphics in the other at the same time.
To maintain the correct aspect ratio (height/width), Tektronix graphics will
be restricted to the largest box with a 4014's aspect ratio that will fit in
the window.
This box is located in the upper left area of the window.
.
.PP
Although both windows may be displayed at the same time, one of them is
considered the \*(``active\*('' window for receiving keyboard input and terminal
output.
This is the window that contains the text cursor.
The active window can be chosen through escape sequences,
the \fBVT Options\fP menu in the VT\fIxxx\fP window,
and the \fBTek Options\fP menu in the 4014 window.
.
.SH EMULATIONS
\fI\*N\fP provides usable emulations of related DEC terminals:
.bP
VT52 emulation is complete.
.bP
VT102 emulation is fairly complete, but does not support autorepeat
(because that would affect the keyboard used by other X clients).
.IP
Double-size characters are displayed properly if your font server supports
scalable bitmap fonts.
.bP
VT220 emulation does not support soft fonts, it is otherwise complete.
.bP
VT420 emulation (the default) supports controls for manipulating rectangles
of characters as well as left/right margins.
.IP
\fI\*N\fP does not support some other features which
are not suitable for emulation, e.g., two-sessions.
.PP
Terminal database (\fIterminfo\fP (5) or \fItermcap\fP (5))
entries that work with \fI\*n\fP include
.IP
an optional platform-specific entry (\*(``__default_termname__\*(''),
.br
\*(``xterm\*('',
.br
\*(``vt102\*('',
.br
\*(``vt100\*('',
.br
\*(``ansi\*('' and
.br
\*(``dumb\*(''
.PP
\fI\*N\fP automatically searches the
terminal database in this order for these entries and then
sets the \*(``TERM\*('' variable
(and the \*(``TERMCAP\*('' environment variable on a few older systems).
The alternatives after \*(``xterm\*('' are very old,
from the late 1980s.
.PP
VT100 and VT102 emulations are commonly equated,
though they actually differ.
The VT102 provided controls for inserting and deleting lines.
.PP
Similarly,
\*(``ansi\*('' and
\*(``vt100\*('' are often equated.
These are not really the same.
For instance, they use different controls for scrolling
(but \fI\*n\fP supports both).
These features differ in an \*(``ansi\*('' terminal description
from \fI\*n\fP:
.TP 8
.B acsc
.br
Pseudo-graphics (line-drawing) uses a different mapping.
.TP 8
.B xenl
.br
\fI\*N\fP wraps text at the right margin using
the VT100 \*(``newline glitch\*('' behavior.
.PP
Because of the wrapping behavior, you would occasionally have to
repaint the screen when using a text editor with the \*(``ansi\*('' description.
.PP
You may also use descriptions corresponding to the various
supported emulations such as \*(``vt220\*('' or  \*(``vt420\*('',
but should set the terminal emulation level
with the \fBdecTerminalID\fP resource.
.PP
On most systems, \fI\*n\fP will use the terminfo database.
Some older systems use termcap.
(The \*(``TERMCAP\*('' environment variable is not set if \fI\*n\fP is linked
against a terminfo library, since the requisite information is not provided
by the termcap emulation of terminfo libraries).
.
.PP
Many of the special \fI\*n\fP features may be modified under program control
through a set of escape sequences different from the standard VT\fIxxx\fP escape
sequences (see \fIXterm Control Sequences\fP).
.
.PP
The Tektronix 4014 emulation is also fairly good.
It supports 12-bit graphics addressing, scaled to the window size.
Four different font sizes and five different lines types are supported.
There is no write-through or defocused mode support.
The Tektronix text and graphics commands are recorded internally by \fI\*n\fP
and may be written to a file by sending the COPY escape sequence
(or through the \fBTektronix\fP menu; see below).
The name of the file will be
.NS
\*(``COPY\fIyyyy\fR\-\fIMM\fR\-\fIdd\fR.\fIhh\fR:\fImm\fR:\fIss\fR\*(''
.NE
.PP
where
.IR yyyy ,
.IR MM ,
.IR dd ,
.IR hh ,
.I mm
and
.I ss
are the year, month, day, hour, minute and second when the COPY was performed
(the file is created in the directory \fI\*n\fP
is started in, or the home directory for a login \fI\*n\fP).
.
.PP
Not all of the features described in this manual are necessarily available in
this version of \fI\*n\fP.
Some (e.g., the non-VT220 extensions) are available
only if they were compiled in, though the most commonly-used are in the
default configuration.
.
.SH "OTHER FEATURES"
\fI\*N\fP automatically highlights the text cursor when the
pointer enters the window (selected) and unhighlights it when the pointer
leaves the window (unselected).
If the window is the focus window, then the text cursor is
highlighted no matter where the pointer is.
.
.PP
In VT\fIxxx\fP mode, there are escape sequences to activate and deactivate
an alternate screen buffer, which is the same size as the display area
of the window.
When activated, the current screen is saved and replaced with the alternate
screen.
Saving of lines scrolled off the top of the window is disabled until the
normal screen is restored.
The usual terminal description for \fI\*n\fP allows the visual editor
.IR vi (1)
to switch to the alternate screen for editing and to restore the screen
on exit.
A popup menu entry makes it simple to switch between the normal and
alternate screens for cut and paste.
.
.PP
In either VT\fIxxx\fP or Tektronix mode,
there are escape sequences to change the name of the windows.
Additionally, in VT\fIxxx\fP mode,
\fI\*n\fP implements the window-manipulation control
sequences from \fIdtterm\fP, such as resizing the window, setting its location
on the screen.
.
.PP
\fI\*N\fP allows character-based applications to receive mouse events (currently
button-press and release events, and button-motion events)
as keyboard control sequences.
See \fIXterm Control Sequences\fP for details.
.
.\" ***************************************************************************
.SH OPTIONS
Because \fI\*n\fP uses the X Toolkit library,
it accepts the standard X Toolkit command line options.
\fI\*N\fP also accepts many application-specific options.
.PP
By convention, if an option begins with a \*(``\fB+\fP\*(''
instead of a \*(``\fB\-\fP\*('',
the option is restored to its default value.
.\" ***************************************************************************
.PP
Most of the \fI\*n\fP options are actually parsed by the X Toolkit,
which sets resource values, and
overrides corresponding resource-settings in your X resource files.
\fI\*N\fP provides the X Toolkit with a table of options.
A few of these are marked, telling the X Toolkit to ignore them
(\fB\-help\fP,
\fB\-version\fP,
\fB\-class\fP,
\fB\-e\fP, and
\fB\-into\fP).
After the X Toolkit has parsed the command-line parameters,
it removes those which it handles,
leaving the specially-marked parameters for \fI\*n\fP to handle.
.\" ***************************************************************************
.PP
These options do not set a resource value,
and are handled specially:
.TP 8
.B \-version
This causes \fI\*n\fP to print a version number to the standard output,
and then exit.
.TP 8
.B \-help
This causes \fI\*n\fP to print out a verbose message describing its options,
one per line.
The message is written to the standard output.
After printing the message, \fI\*n\fP exits.
\fI\*N\fP generates this message, sorting it and noting whether
a \*(``\fB\-\fR\fIoption\fP\*(''
or a \*(``\fB+\fR\fIoption\fP\*('' turns the feature on or off,
since some features historically have been one or the other.
\fI\*N\fP generates a concise help message (multiple options per line)
when an unknown option is used, e.g.,
.NS
\*n \-z
.NE
.IP
If the logic for a particular option such as logging is not compiled
into \fI\*n\fP, the help text for that option also is not displayed
by the \fB\-help\fP option.
.PP
The \fB\-version\fP and \fB\-help\fP options are interpreted even if \fI\*n\fP
cannot open the display, and are useful for testing and configuration scripts.
Along with \fB\-class\fP, they are checked before other options.
To do this, \fI\*n\fP has its own (much simpler) argument parser,
along with a table of the X Toolkit's built-in list of options.
.PP
Relying upon the X Toolkit to parse the options and associated values
has the advantages of simplicity and good integration with the X resource
mechanism.
There are a few drawbacks
.bP
\fI\*N\fP cannot tell easily whether a resource value was set by
one of the external resource- or application-defaults files,
whether it was set using \fBxrdb\fP(1),
or if it was set through the \fB\-xrm\fP option
or via some directly relevant command-line option.
\fI\*N\fP sees only the end-result:
a value supplied when creating its widgets.
.bP
\fI\*N\fP does not know the order in which particular options and
items in resource files are evaluated.
Rather, it sees all of the values for a given widget at the same time.
In the design of these options,
some are deemed more important,
and can override other options.
.IP
The X Toolkit uses patterns (constants and wildcards) to match resources.
Once a particular pattern has been used,
it will not modify it.
To override a given setting,
a more-specific pattern must be used,
e.g., replacing \*(``*\*('' with \*(``.\*(''.
Some poorly-designed resource files are too specific
to allow the command-line options to affect the relevant widget values.
.bP
In a few cases,
the X Toolkit combines its standard options in ways which do not work
well with \fI\*n\fP.
This happens with the color (\fB\-fg\fP, \fB\-bg\fP) and reverse (\fB\-rv\fP)
options.
\fI\*N\fP makes a special case of these and
adjusts its sense of \*(``reverse\*(''
to lessen user surprise.
.\" ***************************************************************************
.PP
One parameter (after all options) may be given.
That overrides \fI\*n\fP's built-in choice of shell program:
.bP
If the parameter is not a relative path, i.e.,
beginning with \*(``./\*('' or \*(``../\*('',
\fI\*n\fP looks for the file in the user's PATH.
In either case, this check fails
if \fI\*n\fP cannot construct an absolute path.
.bP
If that check fails (or if no such parameter is given),
\fI\*n\fP next checks the \*(``SHELL\*('' variable.
If that specifies an executable file,
\fI\*n\fP will attempt to start that.
However, \fI\*n\fP additionally checks if it is a valid shell,
and will unset \*(``SHELL\*('' if it is not.
.bP
If \*(``SHELL\*('' is not set to an executable file,
\fI\*n\fP tries to use the shell program specified
in the user's password file entry.
As before, \fI\*n\fP verifies if this is a valid shell.
.bP
Finally, if the password file entry does not specify a valid shell,
\fI\*n\fP uses \fI/bin/sh\fP.
.PP
The \fB\-e\fP option cannot be used with this parameter since
it uses all parameters following the option.
.PP
\fI\*N\fP validates shell programs by finding their pathname in
the text file \fB/etc/shells\fP.
It treats the environment variable \*(``SHELL\*('' specially because
(like \*(``TERM\*(''), \fI\*n\fP both reads and updates the variable,
and because the program started by \fI\*n\fP is not necessarily a shell.
.\" ***************************************************************************
.PP
The other options are used to control the appearance and behavior.
Not all options are necessarily configured into your copy of \fI\*n\fP:
.TP 8
.B \-132
Normally, the VT102 DECCOLM escape sequence that switches between 80 and
132 column mode is ignored.
This option causes the DECCOLM escape sequence to be recognized,
and the \fI\*n\fP window will resize appropriately.
.TP 8
.B \-ah
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should always highlight the text cursor.
By default,
\fI\*n\fP will display a hollow text cursor whenever the focus is lost or the
pointer leaves the window.
.TP 8
.B +ah
This option indicates that
\fI\*n\fP should do text cursor highlighting based on focus.
.TP 8
.B \-ai
This option disables active icon support if that feature was compiled
into \fI\*n\fP.
This is equivalent to setting the \fIvt100\fP resource
\fBactiveIcon\fP to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B +ai
This option enables active icon support if that feature was compiled
into \fI\*n\fP.
This is equivalent to setting the \fIvt100\fP resource
\fBactiveIcon\fP to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B \-aw
This option indicates that auto-wraparound should be allowed,
and is equivalent to setting the \fIvt100\fP resource
\fBautoWrap\fP to \*(``true\*(''.
.IP
Auto-wraparound
allows the cursor to automatically wrap to the beginning of the next
line when it is at the rightmost position of a line and text is
output.
.TP 8
.B +aw
This option indicates that auto-wraparound should not be allowed,
and is equivalent to setting the \fIvt100\fP resource
\fBautoWrap\fP to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI \-b " number"
This option specifies the size of the inner border (the distance between
the outer edge of the characters and the window border) in pixels.
That is the \fIvt100\fP \fBinternalBorder\fP resource.
The
default is \*(``2\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI \-baudrate " number"
Set the line-speed, used to test the behavior of applications that
use the line-speed when optimizing their output to the screen.
The
default is \*(``38400\*(''.
.TP 8
.B \-bc
turn on text cursor blinking.
This overrides the \fBcursorBlink\fR resource.
.TP 8
.B +bc
turn off text cursor blinking.
This overrides the \fBcursorBlink\fR resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-bcf " milliseconds"
set the amount of time text cursor is off when blinking via the
\fBcursorOffTime\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-bcn " milliseconds"
set the amount of time text cursor is on when blinking via the
\fBcursorOnTime\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "\-bdc"
Set the \fIvt100\fP resource \fBcolorBDMode\fR to \*(``false\*('',
disabling the display of characters with bold attribute as color.
.TP 8
.B "+bdc"
Set the \fIvt100\fP resource \fBcolorBDMode\fR to \*(``true\*('',
enabling the display of characters with bold attribute as color
rather than bold.
.TP 8
.B "\-cb"
Set the \fIvt100\fP resource \fBcutToBeginningOfLine\fP to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "+cb"
Set the \fIvt100\fP resource \fBcutToBeginningOfLine\fP to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "\-cc \fIcharacterclassrange\fP:\fIvalue\fP[, \&...\&]"
This sets classes indicated by the given ranges for using in selecting by
words (see \fBCHARACTER CLASSES\fP and the \fBcharClass\fP resource).
.TP 8
.B "\-cjk_width"
Set the \fBcjkWidth\fP resource to \*(``true\*(''.
When turned on, characters with East Asian Ambiguous (A) category in UTR 11
have a column width of 2.
Otherwise, they have a column width of 1.
This may be useful for some legacy CJK text
terminal-based programs assuming box drawings and others to have a column
width of 2.
It also should be turned on when you specify a TrueType
CJK double-width (bi-width/monospace) font either with \fB\-fa\fP at
the command line or \fBfaceName\fP resource.
The default is \*(``false\*(''
.TP 8
.B "+cjk_width"
Reset the \fBcjkWidth\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-class " string"
This option allows you to override \fI\*n\fP's resource class.
Normally it is \*(``__default_class__\*('', but
can be set to another class such as
\*(``U__default_class__\*('' to override selected resources.
.IP
X Toolkit sets the \fBWM_CLASS\fP property using the instance name
and this class value.
.TP 8
.B "\-cm"
This option disables recognition of ANSI color-change escape sequences.
It sets the \fBcolorMode\fP resource to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "+cm"
This option enables recognition of ANSI color-change escape sequences.
This is the same as the \fIvt100\fP resource \fBcolorMode\fP.
.TP 8
.B "\-cn"
This option indicates that newlines should not be cut in line-mode
selections.
It sets the \fBcutNewline\fP resource to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B +cn
This option indicates that newlines should be cut in line-mode selections.
It sets the \fBcutNewline\fP resource to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI \-cr " color"
This option specifies the color to use for text cursor.
The default is to
use the same foreground color that is used for text.
It sets the \fBcursorColor\fP resource according to the parameter.
.TP 8
.B \-cu
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should work around a bug in the
.IR more (1)
program that causes it
to incorrectly display lines that are exactly the width of the window and
are followed by a line beginning with a tab
(the leading tabs are not displayed).
This option is so named because it was originally thought to be a bug
in the
.IR curses (3x)
cursor motion package.
.TP 8
.B +cu
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should not work around the
.IR more (1)
bug mentioned above.
.TP 8
.B "\-dc"
This option disables the escape sequence to change dynamic colors:
the vt100 foreground and background colors,
its text cursor color,
the pointer cursor foreground and background colors,
the Tektronix emulator foreground and background colors,
its text cursor color
and highlight color.
The option sets the \fBdynamicColors\fP option to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "+dc"
This option enables the escape sequence to change dynamic colors.
The option sets the \fBdynamicColors\fP option to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI \-e "\fI program \fP[ \fIarguments \fP\&.\|.\|.\& ]\fI"
This option specifies the program (and its command line arguments) to be
run in the \fI\*n\fP window.
It also sets the window title and icon
name to be the basename of the program being executed if neither \fI\-T\fP
nor \fI\-n\fP are given on the command line.
.IP
\fBNOTE:\fP This must be the \fBlast option\fP on the command line.
.TP 8
.BI \-en " encoding"
This option determines the encoding on which \fI\*n\fP runs.
It sets the \fBlocale\fR resource.
Encodings other than UTF-8 are supported by using \fIluit\fR.
The \fB\-lc\fR option should be used instead of \fB\-en\fR for
systems with locale support.
.TP 8
.BI \-fa " pattern"
This option sets the pattern for fonts selected from the FreeType
library if support for that library was compiled into \fI\*n\fP.
This corresponds to the \fBfaceName\fP resource.
When a CJK
double-width font is specified, you also need to turn
on the \fBcjkWidth\fP resource.
.IP
If you specify both \fB\-fa\fP and the X Toolkit option \fB\-fn\fP,
the \fB\-fa\fP setting overrides the latter.
.IP
See also the \fBrenderFont\fP resource,
which combines with this to determine whether FreeType fonts are
initially active.
.TP 8
.BI \-fb " font"
This option specifies a font to be used when displaying bold text.
It sets the \fBboldFont\fR resource.
.IP
This font must be the same height and width as the normal font,
otherwise it is ignored.
If only one of the normal or bold fonts is specified, it will be used as the
normal font and the bold font will be produced by overstriking this font.
.IP
See also the discussion of \fBboldMode\fP and \fBalwaysBoldMode\fP resources.
.TP 8
.B \-fbb
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should
compare normal and bold fonts bounding
boxes to ensure they are compatible.
It sets the \fBfreeBoldBox\fP resource to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B +fbb
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should not
compare normal and bold fonts bounding
boxes to ensure they are compatible.
It sets the \fBfreeBoldBox\fP resource to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B \-fbx
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should not assume that the
normal and bold fonts have VT100 line-drawing characters.
If any are missing, \fI\*n\fP will draw the characters directly.
It sets the \fBforceBoxChars\fP resource to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B +fbx
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should assume that the
normal and bold fonts have VT100 line-drawing characters.
It sets the \fBforceBoxChars\fP resource to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI \-fd " pattern"
This option sets the pattern for double-width fonts selected from the FreeType
library if support for that library was compiled into \fI\*n\fP.
This corresponds to the \fBfaceNameDoublesize\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-fi " font"
This option sets the font for active icons if that feature was compiled
into \fI\*n\fP.
.IP
See also the discussion of the \fBiconFont\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-fs " size"
This option sets the pointsize for fonts selected from the FreeType
library if support for that library was compiled into \fI\*n\fP.
This corresponds to the \fBfaceSize\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B \-fullscreen
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should ask the window manager to
let it use the full-screen for display,
e.g., without window decorations.
It sets the \fBfullscreen\fP resource to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B +fullscreen
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should not ask the window manager to
let it use the full-screen for display.
It sets the \fBfullscreen\fP resource to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B \-fw \fIfont\fP
This option specifies the font to be used for displaying wide text.
By default,
it will attempt to use a font twice as wide as the font that will be used to
draw normal text.
If no double-width font is found, it will improvise, by stretching
the normal font.
This corresponds to the \fBwideFont\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B \-fwb \fIfont\fP
This option specifies the font to be used for displaying bold wide text.
By default,
it will attempt to use a font twice as wide as the font that will be used to
draw bold text.
If no double-width font is found, it will improvise, by stretching
the bold font.
This corresponds to the \fBwideBoldFont\fP resource.
.TP 8

.B \-hf
This option indicates that HP function key escape codes should be generated
for function keys.
It sets the \fBhpFunctionKeys\fP resource to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B +hf
This option indicates that HP function key escape codes should not be generated
for function keys.
It sets the \fBhpFunctionKeys\fP resource to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B \-hm
Tells \fI\*n\fP to use
\fBhighlightTextColor\fP and \fBhighlightColor\fP
to override the reversed foreground/background colors in a selection.
It sets the \fBhighlightColorMode\fP resource to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B +hm
Tells \fI\*n\fP not to use
\fBhighlightTextColor\fP and \fBhighlightColor\fP
to override the reversed foreground/background colors in a selection.
It sets the \fBhighlightColorMode\fP resource to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B \-hold
Turn on the \fBhold\fP resource, i.e.,
\fI\*n\fP will not immediately destroy its window
when the shell command completes.
It will wait until you use the window manager to destroy/kill the window, or
if you use the menu entries that send a signal, e.g., HUP or KILL.
.TP 8
.B +hold
Turn off the \fBhold\fP resource, i.e.,
\fI\*n\fP will immediately destroy its window when the shell command completes.
.TP 8

Turn on the \fBptyInitialErase\fP resource, i.e.,
use the pseudo-terminal's sense of the \fIstty\fP erase value.
.TP 8
.B +ie
Turn off the \fBptyInitialErase\fP resource, i.e.,
set the \fIstty\fP erase value using the \fBkb\fP string
from the termcap entry as a reference, if available.
.TP 8
.B \-im
Turn on the \fBuseInsertMode\fP resource,
which forces use of insert mode by adding appropriate entries to the TERMCAP
environment variable.
(This option is ignored on most systems, because TERMCAP is not used).
.TP 8
.B +im
Turn off the \fBuseInsertMode\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-into " windowId"
Given an X window identifier (an integer, which can be hexadecimal,
octal or decimal according to whether it begins with "0x", "0" or neither),
\fI\*n\fP will reparent its top-level shell widget to that window.
This is used to embed \fI\*n\fP within other applications.
.IP
For instance, there are scripts for Tcl/Tk and Gtk which can be used
to demonstrate the feature.
When using Gtk, there is a limitation of that toolkit which requires
that \fI\*n\fP's \fBallowSendEvents\fP resource is enabled.
.TP 8
.B "\-itc"
Set the \fIvt100\fP resource \fBcolorITMode\fR to \*(``false\*('',
disabling the display of characters with italic attribute as color.
.TP 8
.B "+itc"
Set the \fIvt100\fP resource \fBcolorITMode\fR to \*(``true\*('',
enabling the display of characters with italic attribute as color
rather than italic.
.TP 8
.B \-j
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should do jump scrolling.
It corresponds to the \fBjumpScroll\fP resource.
Normally,
text is scrolled one line at a time; this option allows \fI\*n\fP to move
multiple lines at a time so that it does not fall as far behind.
Its use is
strongly recommended since it makes \fI\*n\fP much faster when scanning
through large amounts of text.
The VT100 escape sequences for enabling and
disabling smooth scroll as well as the \fBVT Options\fP
menu can be used to turn this
feature on or off.
.TP 8
.B +j
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should not do jump scrolling.
.TP 8
.B \-k8
This option sets the \fBallowC1Printable\fP resource.
When \fBallowC1Printable\fP is set, \fI\*n\fP overrides the mapping
of C1 control characters (code 128\(en159) to treat them as printable.
.TP 8
.B +k8
This option resets the \fBallowC1Printable\fP resource.

.B \-l
Turn logging on, unless disabled by the \fBlogInhibit\fP resource.
.IP
Some versions of \fI\*n\fP may have logging enabled.
However, normally logging is not supported,
due to security concerns in the early 1990s.
That was a problem in X11R4 \fBxterm\fP (1989) which was addressed by
a patch to X11R5 late in 1993.
X11R6 included these fixes.
The older version (when running with \fIroot\fP privilege) would create
the log file using \fIroot\fP privilege.
The reason why \fI\*n\fP ran with \fIroot\fP privileges
was to open pseudo-terminals.
Those privileges are now needed only on very old systems:
Unix98 pseudo-terminals made the BSD scheme unnecessary.
.IP
Unless overridden by the \fB\-lf\fP option or the \fBlogFile\fP resource:
.RS
.bP
If the filename is \*(``\-\*('', then logging is sent to the standard output.
.bP
Otherwise a filename is generated, and
the log file is written to the directory from which \fI\*n\fP is invoked.
.bP
The generated filename is of the form
.NS
XtermLog.\fIXXXXXX\fR
.NE

.B +l
Turn logging off.
.TP 8
.B \-lc
Turn on support of various encodings according to the users'
locale setting, i.e., LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG environment variables.
This is achieved by turning on UTF-8 mode and by invoking \fIluit\fR for
conversion between locale encodings and UTF-8.
(\fIluit\fR is not invoked in UTF-8 locales.)
This corresponds to the \fBlocale\fR resource.
.IP
The actual list of encodings which are supported is determined by \fIluit\fR.
Consult the \fIluit\fR manual page for further details.
.IP
See also the discussion of the \fB\-u8\fP option which supports UTF-8 locales.
.TP 8
.B +lc
Turn off support of automatic selection of locale encodings.
Conventional 8bit mode or, in UTF-8 locales or with \fB\-u8\fP option,
UTF-8 mode will be used.
.TP 8
.BI \-lcc " path"
File name for the encoding converter from/to locale encodings
and UTF-8 which is used with \fB\-lc\fP option or \fBlocale\fR resource.
This corresponds to the \fBlocaleFilter\fR resource.
.TP 8
.B \-leftbar
Force scrollbar to the left side of VT100 screen.
This is the default, unless you have set the \fBrightScrollBar\fR resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-lf " filename"
Specify the log filename.
This sets the \fBlogFile\fP resource.
If set to \*(``\-\*('',
\fI\*n\fP writes its log to the standard output.
See the \fB\-l\fP option.
.TP 8
.B \-ls
This option indicates that the shell that is started in the \fI\*n\fP window
will be a login shell (i.e., the first character of argv[0] will be a dash,
indicating to the shell that it should read the user's \&.login or \&.profile).
.IP
The \fB\-ls\fP flag and the \fBloginShell\fP resource
are ignored if \fB\-e\fP is also given,
because \fI\*n\fP does not know how to make the shell
start the given command after whatever it does when it is a login
shell \- the user's shell of choice need not be a Bourne shell after all.
Also, \fI\*n\ \-e\fP is supposed to provide a consistent
functionality for other applications that need to start text-mode
programs in a window, and if \fBloginShell\fP were not ignored, the
result of ~/.profile might interfere with that.
.IP
If you do want the effect of \fB\-ls\fP and \fB\-e\fP simultaneously, you
may get away with something like
.NS 15
\*n \-e /bin/bash \-l \-c "my command here"
.NE
.IP
Finally, \fB\-ls\fP is not completely ignored,
because \fI\*n\ \-ls\ \-e\fP does write a \fI/etc/wtmp\fP entry
(if configured to do so),
whereas \fI\*n\ \-e\fP does not.
.TP 8
.B +ls
This option indicates that the shell that is started should not be a login
shell (i.e., it will be a normal \*(``subshell\*('').
.TP 8
.B \-maximized
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should ask the window manager to
maximize its layout on startup.
This corresponds to the \fBmaximized\fP resource.
.IP
Maximizing is not the reverse of iconifying;
it is possible to do both with certain window managers.
.TP 8

This option disables the display of characters with reverse attribute as color.
.TP 8
.B "+rvc"
This option enables the display of characters with reverse attribute as color.
.TP 8
.B \-rw
This option indicates that reverse-wraparound should be allowed.
This allows
the cursor to back up from the leftmost column of one line to the rightmost
column of the previous line.
This is very useful for editing long shell
command lines and is encouraged.
This option can be turned on and off from
the \fBVT Options\fP menu.
.TP 8
.B +rw
This option indicates that reverse-wraparound should not be allowed.
.TP 8
.B \-s
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP may scroll asynchronously, meaning that
the screen does not have to be kept completely up to date while scrolling.
This allows \fI\*n\fP to run faster when network latencies are very high
and is typically useful when running across a very large internet or many
gateways.
.TP 8
.B +s
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should scroll synchronously.
.TP 8
.B \-samename
Does not send title and icon name change requests when the request
would have no effect: the name is not changed.
This has the advantage
of preventing flicker and the disadvantage of requiring an extra

providing mapping for keypad \*(``+\*('' to \*(``,\*('', and
CTRL-F1 to F13, CTRL-F2 to F14, etc.
.TP 8
.B +sp
This option indicates that the standard escape codes should be generated for
keypad and function keys.
.TP 8
.B \-t
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should start in Tektronix mode, rather
than in VT\fIxxx\fP mode.
Switching between the two windows is done using the
\*(``Options\*('' menus.
.IP
Terminal database (\fIterminfo\fP (5) or \fItermcap\fP (5))

.TP 8
.B +t
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should start in VT\fIxxx\fP mode.
.TP 8
.B \-tb
This option, corresponding to the \fBtoolBar\fR resource,
indicates that \fI\*n\fR should display a toolbar (or menubar)
at the top of its window.
The buttons in the toolbar correspond to
the popup menus, e.g., control/left/mouse for \fBMain Options\fP.
.TP 8
.B +tb

It also specifies the emulation level,
used to determine the type of response to a DA control sequence.
Valid values include vt52, vt100, vt101, vt102, vt220, and vt240
(the \*(``vt\*('' is optional).
The default is \*(``vt__default_termid__\*(''.
The \fIterm_id\fP argument specifies the terminal ID to use.

program.
The keywords and their values are described in detail in the \fBttyModes\fP
resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-tn " name"
This option specifies the name of the terminal type to be set in the TERM
environment variable.
It corresponds to the \fBtermName\fP resource.
This terminal type must exist in the terminal
database
(termcap or terminfo, depending on how \fI\*n\fP is built)
and should have \fIli#\fP and \fIco#\fP entries.
If the terminal type is not found, \fI\*n\fP uses the built-in list
\*(``xterm\*('', \*(``vt102\*('', etc.
.TP 8
.B \-u8
This option sets the \fButf8\fP resource.
When \fButf8\fP is set, \fI\*n\fP interprets incoming data as UTF-8.
This sets the \fBwideChars\fP resource as a side-effect,
but the UTF-8 mode set by this option prevents it from being turned off.
If you must turn UTF-8 encoding on and off,
use the \fB\-wc\fP option or the corresponding \fBwideChars\fP resource,
rather than the \fB\-u8\fP option.
.IP
This option and the \fButf8\fR resource are overridden by
the \fB\-lc\fP and \fB\-en\fP options and \fBlocale\fR resource.
That is, if \fI\*n\fP has been compiled to support \fIluit\fR,

this option is ignored.
We recommend using
the \fB\-lc\fR option or the \*(``\fBlocale:\ true\fR\*('' resource

This option indicates that a visual bell should not be used.
.TP 8
.B \-wc
This option sets the \fBwideChars\fP resource.
.IP
When \fBwideChars\fP is set,
\fI\*n\fP maintains internal structures for 16-bit characters.
If \fI\*n\fP is not started in UTF-8 mode (or if this resource is not set),
initially it maintains those structures to support 8-bit characters.
\fI\*N\fP can later be switched,
using a menu entry or control sequence,
causing it to reallocate those structures to support 16-bit characters.
.IP
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B +wc
This option resets the \fBwideChars\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B \-wf
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should wait for the window to be mapped
the first time before starting the subprocess so that the initial terminal
size settings and environment variables are correct.
It is the application's
responsibility to catch subsequent terminal size changes.
.TP 8
.B +wf
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should not wait before starting the
subprocess.
.TP 8
.B \-ziconbeep \fIpercent\fP
Same as \fBzIconBeep\fP resource.
If percent is non-zero, xterms that produce output while iconified
will cause an XBell sound at the given volume
and have \*(``***\*('' prepended to their icon titles.
Most window managers will detect this change immediately, showing you
which window has the output.
(A similar feature was in x10 \fI\*n\fP.)
.TP 8
.B \-C
This option indicates that this window should receive console output.
This
is not supported on all systems.
To obtain console output, you must be the
owner of the console device, and you must have read and write permission
for it.
If you are running X under \fIxdm\fP on the console screen you may
need to have the session startup and reset programs explicitly change the
ownership of the console device in order to get this option to work.
.TP 8
.B \-S\fIccn\fP
This option allows \fI\*n\fP to be used as an input and
output channel for an existing program and is sometimes used in specialized
applications.
The option value specifies the last few letters of the name of a pseudo-terminal
to use in slave mode, plus the number of the inherited file descriptor.
If the option contains a \*(``/\*('' character, that delimits the characters
used for the pseudo-terminal name from the file descriptor.
Otherwise, exactly two characters are used from the option for
the pseudo-terminal name, the remainder is the file descriptor.

\fI\*N\fP's VT100 window has two borders:
the \fIinner\fP border \fBinternalBorder\fP
and the \fIouter\fP border \fBborderWidth\fP, managed by the X Toolkit.
.IP
Normally \fI\*n\fP fills the inner border using the VT100 window's
background color.
If the \fBcolorInnerBorder\fP resource is enabled,
then \fI\*n\fP may fill the inner border using the \fBborderColor\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B \-bg \fIcolor\fP
This option specifies the color to use for the background of the window.
The corresponding resource name is \fIbackground\fP.
The default is \*(``XtDefaultBackground\*(''.
.TP 8
.B \-bw \fInumber\fP
This option specifies the width in pixels of the border surrounding the window.
.IP
This appears to be a legacy of older X releases.
It sets the \fBborderWidth\fP resource of the shell widget,
and may provide advice to your window manager to set the thickness of the
window frame.
Most window managers do not use this information.
See the \fB\-b\fP option, which controls the inner border of the \fI\*n\fP
window.
.TP 8
.B \-display \fIdisplay\fP
This option specifies the X server to contact; see X(__miscmansuffix__).
.TP 8
.B \-fg \fIcolor\fP
This option specifies the color to use for displaying text.
The corresponding resource name is \fIforeground\fP.
The default is
\*(``XtDefaultForeground\*(''.
.TP 8
.B \-fn \fIfont\fP
This option specifies the font to be used for displaying normal text.
The corresponding resource name is \fIfont\fP.
The resource value default is \fIfixed\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-font \fIfont\fP
This is the same as \fB\-fn\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-geometry \fIgeometry\fP
This option specifies the preferred size and position of the VT\fIxxx\fP window;
see X(__miscmansuffix__).
.IP
The normal geometry specification can be suffixed with \fB@\fP followed by a
Xinerama screen specification; it can be either \fBg\fP for the global
screen (default), \fBc\fP for the current screen or a screen number.
.TP 8
.B \-iconic
.br
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should ask the window manager to
start it as an icon rather than as the normal window.
The corresponding resource name is \fIiconic\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-name \fIname\fP
This option specifies the application name under which resources are to be
obtained, rather than the default executable file name.
\fIName\fP should not contain \*(``.\*('' or \*(``*\*('' characters.
.TP 8
.B \-rv
This option indicates that reverse video should be simulated by swapping
the foreground and background colors.
The corresponding resource name is \fBreverseVideo\fP.
.TP 8
.B +rv
Disable the simulation of reverse video by swapping foreground and background
colors.
.TP 8
.B \-title \fIstring\fP
This option specifies the window title string, which may be displayed by
window managers if the user so chooses.
It is shorthand for specifying the \*(``\fBtitle\fP\*('' resource.
The default title is the command
line specified after the \fB\-e\fP option, if any, otherwise the application
name.
.IP
X Toolkit sets the \fBWM_NAME\fP property using this value.
.TP 8
.B \-xrm \fIresourcestring\fP
This option specifies a resource string to be used.
This is especially
useful for setting resources that do not have separate command line options.
.PP
X Toolkit accepts alternate names for a few of these options, e.g.,
.bP
\*(``\fB\-background\fP\*('' for \*(``\fB\-bg\fP\*(''
.bP
\*(``\fB\-font\fP\*('' for \*(``\fB\-fn\fP\*(''
.bP
\*(``\fB\-foreground\fP\*('' for \*(``\fB\-fg\fP\*(''
.PP
Abbreviated options also are supported, e.g.,
\*(``\fB\-v\fP\*('' for \*(``\fB\-verbose\fP.\*(''
.
.
.SH RESOURCES
\fI\*N\fP understands all of the core X Toolkit resource names and classes.
It also uses the X Toolkit resource types (such as
booleans,
colors,
fonts, 
integers, and
strings)
along with their respective converters.
Those resource types are not always sufficient:
.bP
\fI\*N\fP's resource values may be lists of names.
X Toolkit resource types do not include lists.
\fI\*N\fP uses a string for the resource, and parses it.
.IP
Comma-separated lists of names ignore case.
.bP
\fI\*N\fP may defer processing a resource until it is needed.
For example, \fBfont2\fP through \fBfont7\fP are loaded as needed,
to start faster.
Again, the actual resource type is a string,
parsed and used when needed.
.PP

if \fBbackarrowKeyIsErase\fP is true, \fI\*n\fP uses the \fIerase\fP
character for the initial state of \fBDECBKM\fP
.bP
if \fBbackarrowKeyIsErase\fP is false, \fI\*n\fP sets \fBDECBKM\fP
to 2 (internal).
This ties together \fBbackarrowKey\fP
and the control sequence for \fBDECBKM\fP.
.bP
applications can send a control sequence to set/reset \fBDECBKM\fP control set

.B "buffered\fP (class\fB Buffered\fP)"
Normally \fI\*n\fP is built with double-buffer support.
This resource can be used to turn it on or off.
Setting the resource to
\*(``true\*(''
turns double-buffering on.
The default value is \*(``__double_buffer__\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "bufferedFPS\fP (class\fB BufferedFPS\fP)"
When \fI\*n\fP is built with double-buffer support,
this gives the maximum number of frames/second.
The default is
\*(``40\*(''

.TP 8
.B "fullscreen\fP (class\fB Fullscreen\fP)"
Specifies whether or not \fI\*n\fP should ask the window manager to
use a fullscreen layout on startup.
\fI\*N\fP accepts either a keyword (ignoring case)
or the number shown in parentheses:
.RS
.TP 3
false (0)
Fullscreen layout is not used initially,
but may be later via menu-selection or control sequence.
.TP 3
true (1)
Fullscreen layout is used initially,
but may be disabled later via menu-selection or control sequence.
.TP 3
always (2)
Fullscreen layout is used initially,

.RE
.IP
The default is
\*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "hold\fP (class\fB Hold\fP)"
If true,
\fI\*n\fP will not immediately destroy its window
when the shell command completes.
It will wait until you use the window manager to destroy/kill the window, or
if you use the menu entries that send a signal, e.g., HUP or KILL.
You may scroll back, select text, etc., to perform most graphical operations.
Resizing the display will lose data, however, since this involves interaction
with the shell which is no longer running.
.TP 8
.B "hpFunctionKeys\fP (class\fB HpFunctionKeys\fP)"
Specifies whether or not HP function key escape codes should be generated for
function keys.
The default is
\*(``false\*('', i.e., this feature is disabled.
.IP
The \fBkeyboardType\fP resource is the preferred mechanism
for selecting this mode.
.TP 8
.B "iconGeometry\fP (class\fB IconGeometry\fP)"
Specifies the preferred size and position of the application when iconified.
It is not necessarily obeyed by all window managers.
.TP 8
.B "iconHint\fP (class\fB IconHint\fP)"
Specifies an icon which will be added to the window manager hints.
\fI\*N\fP provides no default value.
.IP
Set this resource to \*(``none\*('' to omit the hint entirely,
using whatever the window manager may decide.
.IP
If the \fBiconHint\fP resource is given (or is set via the \fB\-n\fP option)
\fI\*n\fP searches for a pixmap file with that name,
in the current directory as well as in __pixmapsdir__.
if the resource does not specify an absolute pathname.
In each case, \fI\*n\fP adds \*(``_48x48\*(''
and/or \*(``.xpm\*('' to the filename
after trying without those suffixes.
If it is able to load the file, \fI\*n\fP sets the window manager
hint for the icon-pixmap.
These pixmaps are distributed with \fI\*n\fP, and can optionally be
compiled-in:
.RS
.bP
mini.\*n_16x16,
mini.\*n_32x32,

\*n\-color_48x48
.RE
.IP
In either case, \fI\*n\fP allows for adding a \*(``_48x48\*('' to specify the
largest of the pixmaps as a default.
That is, \*(``mini.\*n\*('' is the same as \*(``mini.\*n_48x48\*(''.
.IP
If no explicit \fBiconHint\fP resource is given
(or if none of the compiled-in names matches),
\fI\*n\fP uses \*(``mini.\*n\*('' (which is always compiled-in).
.IP
The \fBiconHint\fP resource has no effect on \*(``desktop\*('' files,
including \*(``panel\*('' and \*(``menu\*(''.
Those are typically set via a \*(``.desktop\*('' file;
\fI\*n\fP provides samples for itself (and the \fIu\*n\fP script).
The more capable desktop systems allow changing the icon on a per-user basis.
.TP 8
.B "iconName\fP (class\fB IconName\fP)"
Specifies a label for \fI\*n\fP when iconified.
\fI\*N\fP provides no default value;
some window managers may assume the application name, e.g., \*(``\*n\*(''.
.IP
Setting the \fBiconName\fP resource sets the icon label
unless overridden by \fBzIconBeep\fP
or the control sequences which change the window and icon labels.
.TP 8

Enables one (or none) of the various keyboard-type resources:
\fBhpFunctionKeys\fP,
\fBscoFunctionKeys\fP,
\fBsunFunctionKeys\fP,

\*(``tcap\*('',
\*(``legacy\*('' or
\*(``vt220\*('', respectively.
.IP
The individual resources are provided for legacy support;
this resource is simpler to use.
\fI\*N\fP will use only one keyboard-type,
but if multiple resources are set, it warns and uses the last one it checks.
.IP
The default is
\*(``unknown\*('', i.e., none of the associated resources are set
via this resource.
.TP 8
.B "maxBufSize\fP (class\fB MaxBufSize\fP)"
Specify the maximum size of the input buffer.
The default is \*(``32768\*(''.
You cannot set this to a value less than the \fBminBufSize\fR resource.
It will be increased as needed to make that value evenly divide this one.
.IP
On some systems you may want to increase one or both of the
\fBmaxBufSize\fP and
\fBminBufSize\fP resource values to achieve better performance
if the operating system prefers larger buffer sizes.
.TP 8

.TP 8
.B "menuLocale\fP (class\fB MenuLocale\fP)"
Specify the locale used for character-set computations when loading
the popup menus.
Use this to improve initialization performance of the Athena popup menus,
which may load unnecessary (and very large) fonts, e.g.,
in a locale having UTF-8 encoding.
The default is \*(``C\*('' (POSIX).

The \fIPOSIX\fP column in the table indicates which keywords
are supported by a standard \fIstty\fP program.
.IP
If the \fBttyModes\fP resource specifies a value for \fBerase\fP,
that overrides the \fBptyInitialErase\fP resource setting,
i.e., \fI\*n\fP initializes the terminal to match that value.
.TP 8
.B "useInsertMode\fP (class\fB UseInsertMode\fP)"
Force use of insert mode by adding appropriate entries to the TERMCAP
environment variable.
This is useful if the system termcap is broken.
(This resource is ignored on most systems, because TERMCAP is not used).
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "utmpDisplayId\fP (class\fB UtmpDisplayId\fP)"
Specifies whether or not \fI\*n\fP should try to record the display
identifier (display number and screen number) as well as the hostname in
the system \fIutmp\fP log file.
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "utmpInhibit\fP (class\fB UtmpInhibit\fP)"
Specifies whether or not \fI\*n\fP should try to record the user's terminal

Augment (add to) the system's \fI/etc/shells\fP,
when determining whether to set the \*(``SHELL\*('' environment

.IP
The resource value is a list of lines (separated by newlines).
Each line holds one pathname.
\fI\*N\fP ignores any line beginning with \*(``#\*(''
after trimming leading/trailing whitespace from each line.
.IP
The default is an empty string.
.TP 8
.B "waitForMap\fP (class\fB WaitForMap\fP)"
Specifies whether or not \fI\*n\fP should wait for the initial window map
before starting the subprocess.
This is part of the \fBptyHandshake\fP logic.
When \fI\*n\fP is directed to wait in this fashion,
it passes the terminal size from the display end of the pseudo-terminal
to the terminal I/O connection, e.g.,
using the size according to the window manager.
Otherwise, it uses the size as given in resource values or command-line
option \fB\-geometry\fP.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "zIconBeep\fP (class\fB ZIconBeep\fP)"
Same as \-ziconbeep command line argument.
If the value of this resource is non-zero, xterms that produce output
while iconified will cause an XBell sound at the given volume
and have \*(``***\ \*('' prepended to their icon titles.
Most window managers will detect this change immediately, showing you
which window has the output.
(A similar feature was in x10 \fI\*n\fR.)
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "zIconTitleFormat\fP (class\fB ZIconTitleFormat\fP)"
Allow customization of the string used in the \fBzIconBeep\fP feature.
The default value is \*(``***\ %s\*(''.
.IP
If the resource value contains a \*(``%s\*('',
then \fI\*n\fP inserts the icon title at that point rather
than prepending the string to the icon title.
(Only the first \*(``%s\*('' is used).

.SS VT100 Widget Resources
.PP
The following resources are specified as part
of the \fIvt100\fP widget (class \fIVT100\fP).
They are specified by patterns such as
\*(``\fB__default_class__.vt100.\fP\fINAME\fP\*(''.
.PP
If your \fI\*n\fP is configured to support the \*(``toolbar\*('', then those
patterns need an extra level for the form-widget which holds the
toolbar and vt100 widget.
A wildcard between the top-level \*(``__default_class__\*(''
and the \*(``vt100\*('' widget makes the resource settings work for either,
e.g., \*(``\fB__default_class__*vt100.\fP\fINAME\fP\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "activeIcon\fP (class\fB ActiveIcon\fP)"
Specifies whether or not active icon windows are to be used when the
\fI\*n\fP window is iconified, if this feature is compiled into \fI\*n\fR.
The active icon is a miniature representation of the content of the
window and will update as the content changes.
Not all window managers necessarily support application icon windows.
Some window managers
will allow you to enter keystrokes into the active icon window.
The default is \*(``default\*(''.
.IP
\fI\*N\fP accepts either a keyword (ignoring case)

The active icon is shown.
If you are using \fItwm\fP, use this setting to enable active-icons.
.TP

\fI\*N\fP checks at startup, and shows an active icon only for window
managers which it can identify and which are known to support the feature.
These are \fIfvwm\fP (full support), and \fIwindow maker\fP (limited).
A few other windows managers (such as \fItwm\fP and \fIctwm\fP)
support active icons,
but do not support the extensions which allow \fI\*n\fP
to identify the window manager.

escape sequences to the host on mouse-clicks and movement.
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "allowPasteControls\fP (class\fB AllowPasteControls\fP)"
If true, allow control characters such as BEL and CAN to be pasted.
Formatting characters (tab, newline) are always allowed.
Other C0 control characters are suppressed unless this resource is enabled.
The exact set of control characters (C0 and C1)
depends upon whether UTF-8 encoding is used,
as well as the \fBallowC1Printable\fP resource.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "allowScrollLock\fP (class\fB AllowScrollLock\fP)"
Specifies whether control sequences that set/query
the Scroll Lock key should be allowed,
as well as whether the Scroll Lock key responds to user's keypress.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.IP
When this feature is enabled, \fI\*n\fP will sense the state of the
Scroll Lock key each time it acquires focus.
Pressing the Scroll Lock key toggles \fI\*n\fP's internal state,
as well as toggling the associated LED.
While the Scroll Lock is active, \fI\*n\fP attempts to keep a viewport on the
same set of lines.
If the current viewport is scrolled past the limit set by the
\fBsaveLines\fP resource, then Scroll Lock has no further effect.
.IP
The reason for setting the default to \*(``false\*('' is to avoid
user surprise.
This key is generally unused in keyboard configurations,
and has not acquired a standard meaning even when it is used in that manner.
Consequently, users have assigned it for ad hoc purposes.
.TP 8
.B "allowSendEvents\fP (class\fB AllowSendEvents\fP)"
Specifies whether or not synthetic key and button events (generated using
the X protocol SendEvent request) should be interpreted or discarded.
The default is \*(``false\*('' meaning they are discarded.
Note that allowing such events would create a very large security hole,
therefore enabling this resource forcefully disables
the \fBallow\fP\fIXXX\fP\fBOps\fR resources.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP
.B "allowTcapOps\fP (class\fB AllowTcapOps\fP)"
Specifies whether control sequences that query the terminal's
notion of its function-key strings, as termcap or terminfo capabilities
should be allowed.
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.IP
A few programs, e.g., \fIvim\fP, use this feature to get an accurate
description of the terminal's capabilities,
independent of the termcap/terminfo setting:
.RS
.bP
\fI\*N\fP can tell the querying program how many colors it supports.
This is a constant, depending on how it is compiled, typically 16.
It does not change if you alter resource settings,
e.g., the \fBboldColors\fP resource.
.bP
\fI\*N\fP can tell the querying program what strings are sent by modified

Reporting control- and alt-modifiers is a feature that relies on the
\fIncurses\fP extended naming.

Specifies whether extended window control sequences
(as used in \fIdtterm\fP)
should be allowed.
These include several control sequences which manipulate the window size or
position, as well as reporting these values and the title or icon name.
Each of these can be abused in a script;
curiously enough most terminal emulators that implement these

.bP
When using bitmap fonts, it is possible that the font server will
approximate the bold font by rescaling it from
a different font size than expected.
The \fBalwaysBoldMode\fP resource

The problem does not occur with TrueType fonts (though there can be
other unnecessary issues such as different coverage of the normal

This corresponds to the DECBKM control sequence.
A \*(``true\*('' value specifies backspace.
The default is \*(``__backarrow_is_bs__\*(''.
Pressing the control key toggles this behavior.

Default is 200.
If set non-zero,
additional bells
will also be suppressed until the server reports that processing of
the first bell has been completed; this feature is most useful with
the visible bell.
.TP 8
.B "boldColors\fP (class\fB ColorMode\fP)"
Specifies whether to combine bold attribute with colors like the IBM PC,
i.e., map colors 0 through 7 to colors 8 through 15.
These normally are the brighter versions of the first 8 colors, hence bold.
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "boldFont\fP (class\fB BoldFont\fP)"
Specifies the name of the bold font to use instead of overstriking.
There is no default for this resource.
.IP
This font must be the same height and width as the normal font,
otherwise it is ignored.
If only one of the normal or bold fonts is specified, it will be used as the

same as the normal font.
It may be desirable to disable bold fonts when color is being
used for the bold attribute.

Note that \fI\*n\fP has one bold font which you may set explicitly.
\fI\*N\fP attempts to derive a bold font for the other font selections
(\fBfont1\fP through \fBfont7\fP).
If it cannot find a bold font, it will use the normal font.
In each case (whether the explicit resource or the derived font),

Although \fI\*n\fP attempts to derive a bold font for other font selections,
the font server may not cooperate.
Since X11R6, bitmap fonts have been scaled.
The font server claims to provide the bold font that \fI\*n\fP requests,

XFree86 introduced a feature which can be used to suppress the scaling.
In the X server's configuration file (e.g., \*(``/etc/X11/XFree86\*(''

Specifies the color to use for the text cursor.
The default is \*(``XtDefaultForeground\*(''.
By default,
\fI\*n\fP attempts to keep this color from being the same as the background

The \fBmetaSendsEscape\fP

Generally keyboards do not have a key labeled \*(``Meta\*('',
but \*(``Alt\*('' keys are common,
and they are conventionally used for \*(``Meta\*(''.
If they were synonymous, it would have been reasonable to name this
resource \*(``\fBaltSendsEscape\fP\*('', reversing its sense.
For more background on this, see the \fBmeta\fP(3x) function in curses.
.IP
Note that the \fIAlt\fP key is not necessarily the same as the
\fIMeta\fP modifier.
The \fIxmodmap\fP utility lists your key modifiers.
X defines modifiers for shift, (caps) lock and control,
as well as 5 additional modifiers which are generally used to configure
key modifiers.
\fI\*N\fP inspects the same information to find the modifier associated
with either \fIMeta\fP key (left or right),
and uses that key as the \fIMeta\fP modifier.
It also looks for the NumLock key,
to recognize the modifier which is associated with that.
.IP
If your \fIxmodmap\fP configuration
uses the same keycodes for Alt- and Meta-keys,
\fI\*n\fP will only see the Alt-key definitions, since those are tested
before Meta-keys.
NumLock is tested first.
It is important to keep these keys distinct;
otherwise some of \fI\*n\fP's functionality is not available.

For some configurations this is unsuccessful; failure is ignored.
After startup, \fI\*n\fP does not

.IP
As originally implemented in X11,
the resource value did not change after startup.
However
(since patch #216 in 2006)
\fI\*n\fP can modify \fBeightBitInput\fP after startup
via a control sequence.
The corresponding terminfo capabilities \fBsmm\fP (set meta mode)
and \fBrmm\fP (reset meta mode)
have been recognized by \fIbash\fP for some time.
Interestingly enough, \fIbash\fP's notion of \*(``meta mode\*(''
differs from the standard definition (in the \fIterminfo\fP manual),
which describes the change to the eighth bit of a character.
It happens that \fIbash\fP views \*(``meta mode\*(''
as the ESC character that \fI\*n\fP puts before a character when a
special meta key is pressed.
\fIbash\fP's early documentation talks about the ESC character
and ignores the eighth bit.

There is no default value.
.IP
One or more fonts can be specified, separated by commas.
If prefixed with \*(``x:\*('' or \*(``x11:\*('' the specification
applies to the XLFD \fBfont\fP resource.
A \*(``xft:\*('' prefix is accepted but unnecessary since
a missing prefix for \fBfaceName\fP means that it will be used for TrueType.
For example,
.NS

.NE
.IP
If no \fBfaceName\fP resource is specified,

\fI\*N\fP stores data as it is shown on the screen.
Erasing the display changes the internal state of each cell

Regardless of your locale and encoding,
you need an ISO-10646-1 font to display the result.
Your configuration may not include this font,

At startup, \fI\*n\fP uses a mechanism equivalent to
the \fBload\-vt\-fonts(utf8Fonts,\ Utf8Fonts)\fP action
to load font name subresources of the VT100 widget.
That is,
resource patterns such as \*(``\fB*vt100.utf8Fonts.font\fP\*('' will be loaded,
and (if this resource is enabled), override the normal fonts.
If no subresources are found,
the normal fonts such as \*(``\fB*vt100.font\fP\*('', etc., are used.

For instance, you could have this in your resource file:
.NS

When started with a UTF-8 locale, \fI\*n\fP would use 9x15, but
allow you to switch to the 12x24 font
using the menu entry \*(``\fBUTF\-8 Fonts\fP\*(''.

encodings and UTF-8 which is used with
the \fB\-lc\fR option or \fBlocale\fR resource.
The help message shown by \*(``\*n \-help\*('' lists the default value,

Alternatively,
you may put those parameter within a shell script to execute the converter,
and set this resource to point to the shell script.

Except for those special cases built into the X11 library,
the Shift- and Control- modifiers are treated normally.

for sending special escape sequences to the application.
\fI\*N\fP normally allows you
to use the \fIshift\fP-key
to temporarily override this mouse protocol,
permitting the selection and copying actions to be used.
.IP
The \fBshiftEscape\fP resource setting allows you
to tell \fI\*n\fP whether to use
the \fIshift\fP-key in this way (i.e., overriding the mouse protocol).
\fI\*N\fP accepts either a keyword (ignoring case)
or the number shown in parentheses:
.RS
.TP 3
false (0)
Mouse protocol does not send special escapes when \fIshift\fP-key is used.
.TP 3
true (1)
Mouse protocol may send special escapes when \fIshift\fP-key is used.
.IP
At startup,
\fI\*n\fP analyzes the \fBtranslations\fP to see which buttons are used
in the (mouse) button-related bindings for selection and copying text.
If the \fIshift\fP-key is not mentioned explicitly in a button's binding,
\fI\*n\fP allows that button with \fIshift\fP-key for overriding the
mouse protocol.
.TP 3
always (2)
Mouse protocol can always send special escapes when \fIshift\fP-key is used.
.TP 3
never (3)
Mouse protocol will never send special escapes when \fIshift\fP-key is used.

the shifted KP_Add and KP_Subtract.
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "showBlinkAsBold\fP (class\fB ShowBlinkAsBold\fP)"
Tells \fI\*n\fP whether to display text with blink-attribute the same

The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "sixelScrolling\fP (class\fB SixelScrolling\fP)"
If \fI\*n\fR is configured to support SIXEL graphics,
this resource tells it whether to
scroll up one line at a time when sixels would be written
past the bottom line on the window.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "sixelScrollsRight\fP (class\fB SixelScrollsRight\fP)"
If \fI\*n\fR is configured to support SIXEL graphics,
this resource tells it whether to

Specifies whether \fI\*n\fP should scroll to a new page when processing
the \fIti\fP termcap entry, i.e., the private modes 47, 1047 or 1049.
This is only in effect if \fBtiteInhibit\fP is \*(``true\*('',
because the intent of this option is to provide a picture of the full-screen
application's display on the scrollback without wiping out the text that
would be shown before the application was initialized.
The default for this resource is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "titeInhibit\fP (class\fB TiteInhibit\fP)"
Originally specified whether or not \fI\*n\fP

termcap entries (used to switch between alternate screens on startup of many
screen-oriented programs) from the TERMCAP string.
.IP
TERMCAP is used rarely now,

.RS
.bP
If set,
\fI\*n\fP also ignores the escape sequence to switch to the
alternate screen.
.bP
\fI\*N\fP supports terminfo in a different way, supporting composite control

.B "titleModes\fP (class\fB TitleModes\fP)"
Tells \fI\*n\fP whether to accept or return
window- and icon-labels in ISO-8859-1

Either can be encoded in hexadecimal:
.RS
.bP
UTF-8 titles require special treatment,
because they may contain bytes which can be mistaken for control characters.
Hexadecimal-encoding is supported to eliminate that possibility.
.bP
As an alternative, you could use the \fBallowC1Printable\fP resource,
which suppresses \fI\*n\fP's parsing of the relevant control characters
(and as a result, treats those bytes as data).
.RE
.IP
The default for this resource is \*(``0\*(''.
.IP
Each bit (bit \*(``0\*('' is 1, bit \*(``1\*('' is 2, etc.)
corresponds to one of the

.RS
.TP 5
0
Set window/icon labels using hexadecimal
.TP 5

.RE
.TP 8
.B "translations\fP (class\fB Translations\fP)"
Specifies the key and button bindings for menus, selections, \*(``programmed

The \fBtranslations\fP resource,
which provides much of \fI\*n\fP's configurability,
is a feature of the X Toolkit Intrinsics library (Xt).
See the \fBActions\fP section.
.TP 8
.B "trimSelection\fP (class\fB TrimSelection\fP)"
If you set \fBhighlightSelection\fP,
you can see the text which is selected, including any trailing spaces.
Clearing the screen (or a line) resets it to a state containing no spaces.
Some lines may contain trailing spaces when an application writes them to
the screen.
However, you may not wish to paste lines with trailing spaces.
If this resource is true, \fI\*n\fP will trim trailing spaces from
text which is selected.
It does not affect spaces which result in a wrapped line, nor will it
trim the trailing newline from your selection.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "underLine\fP (class\fB UnderLine\fP)"
This specifies whether or not text with the underline attribute should be
underlined.
It may be desirable to disable underlining when color is being
used for the underline attribute.
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "useBorderClipping\fP (class\fB UseBorderClipping\fP)"
Tell \fI\*n\fP whether to apply clipping when \fBuseClipping\fP is false.
Unlike \fBuseClipping\fP, this simply limits text to keep it within the
window borders, e.g., as a refinement to the \fBscaleHeight\fP workaround.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "useClipping\fP (class\fB UseClipping\fP)"
Tell \fI\*n\fP whether to use clipping to keep
from producing dots outside the text drawing area.
Originally used to work around for overstriking effects,
this is also needed to work with some incorrectly-sized fonts.
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "utf8\fP (class\fB Utf8\fP)"
This specifies whether \fI\*n\fP will run in UTF-8 mode.
If you set this resource, \fI\*n\fP also sets the \fBwideChars\fP resource
as a side-effect.
The resource can be set via the menu entry \*(``UTF\-8 Encoding\*(''.
The default is \*(``default\*(''.
.IP
\fI\*N\fP accepts either a keyword (ignoring case)
or the number shown in parentheses:
.RS
.TP 3
false (0)
UTF-8 mode is initially off.
The command-line option \fB+u8\fP sets the resource to this value.
Escape sequences for turning UTF-8 mode on/off are allowed.
.TP
true (1)
UTF-8 mode is initially on.
Escape sequences for turning UTF-8 mode on/off are allowed.

The default is an empty string, i.e., \*(``\*('',
which does not override anything.
.TP 8
.B "utf8Title\fP (class\fB Utf8Title\fP)"
Applications can set \fI\*n\fP's title by writing a control sequence.
Normally this control sequence follows the VT220 convention,
which encodes the string in ISO-8859-1 and
allows for an 8-bit string terminator.
If \fI\*n\fP is started in a UTF-8 locale,
it translates the ISO-8859-1 string to UTF-8 to work with the X libraries
which assume the string is UTF-8.
.IP
However, some users may wish to write a title string encoded in UTF-8.
The window manager is responsible for drawing window titles.
Some window managers (not all) support UTF-8 encoding of window titles.
Set this resource to \*(``true\*('' to also set UTF-8 encoded title strings
using the EWMH properties.
.IP
This feature is available as a menu entry, since it is related to
the particular applications you are running within \fI\*n\fP.

draw normal text.
If no double-width font is found, it will improvise, by stretching
the normal font.
.TP 8
.B "ximFont\fP (class\fB XimFont\fP)"
This option specifies the font to be used for displaying the preedit string
in the \*(``OverTheSpot\*('' input method.
.IP
In \*(``OverTheSpot\*('' preedit type, the preedit (preconversion)
string is displayed at the position of the cursor.
It is the XIM server's responsibility to display the preedit string.
The XIM client must inform the XIM server of the cursor position.
For best results, the preedit string must be displayed with a proper font.
Therefore, \fI\*n\fP informs the XIM server of the proper font.
The font is be supplied by a "fontset", whose default value is \*(``*\*(''.
This matches every font, the X library automatically chooses fonts with
proper charsets.

.SS Scrollbar Resources
.PP
The following resources are useful when specified for the Athena Scrollbar
widget:
.TP 8
.B "background\fP (class\fB Background\fP)"
Specifies the color to use for the background of the scrollbar.
.TP 8
.B "foreground\fP (class\fB Foreground\fP)"
Specifies the color to use for the foreground of the scrollbar.
.TP 8
.B "thickness\fP (class\fB Thickness\fP)"
Specifies the width in pixels of the scrollbar (default: 14).
.IP
This may be overridden by the \fBwidth\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "thumb\fP (class\fB Thumb\fP)"
The default \*(``thumb\*('' pixmap used for
the scrollbar is a simple checkerboard pattern alternating pixels for
foreground and background color.
.TP 8
.B "width\fP (class\fB Width\fP)"
Specifies the width in pixels of the scrollbar (default: 0).
.IP
The widget checks the \fIwidth\fP resource first,
using the \fIthickness\fP value if the \fIwidth\fP is zero.
.
.
.SH "POINTER USAGE"
.
.PP
Once the VT\fIxxx\fP window is created,
\fI\*n\fP allows you to select text and copy it within the same or other windows
using the \fIpointer\fP or the keyboard.
.
.PP
A \*(``pointer\*('' could be a mouse, touchpad or similar device.
X applications generally do not care,
since they see only \fIbutton events\fP which have
.bP
position and
.bP
button up/down state
.PP
\fI\*N\fP can see these events as long as it has \fIfocus\fP.
.PP
The keyboard also supplies events, but it is less flexible than
the pointer for selecting/copying text.
.PP
\fIEvents\fP are applied to \fIactions\fP using the \fBtranslations\fP resource.
See \fBActions\fP for a complete list, and \fBDefault Key Bindings\fP
for the built-in set of \fBtranslations\fP resources.
.
.SS "Selection Functions"
.PP
By default,
the selection functions are invoked
when the pointer buttons are used with no modifiers,
and when they are used with the \*(``shift\*('' key.
The \*(``shift\*('' key is special,
because \fI\*n\fP uses that to ensure that selection functions
are still available when it is programmed to send escape sequences
in one of the mouse modes
(see \fIXterm Control Sequences\fP,
as well as the resource \fBdisallowedMouseOps\fP).
.PP
At startup, \fI\*n\fP inspects the \fBtranslations\fP resource to
see which pointer buttons may be used in this way,
and remembers these buttons when deciding whether to send
escape sequences or perform selection
when those buttons are used with the \*(``shift\*('' modifier.
Other pointer buttons, e.g., typically those sent for wheel mouse events,
are not affected.
.PP
The assignment of the functions described below to keys and buttons may
be changed through the resource database; see \fBActions\fP below.
.
.TP 5
Pointer button one (usually left)
is used to save text into the cut buffer:
.NS
~Meta <Btn1Down>:\fBselect\-start\fP()
.NE
.IP
Move the cursor to beginning of the text,
and then hold the button down while moving the cursor to the end of the region
and releasing the button.
The selected text is highlighted and is saved in the global \fIcut buffer\fP
and made the selection when the button is released:
.NS
<BtnUp>:\fBselect\-end\fP(\fBSELECT\fP, \fBCUT_BUFFER0\fP) \en
.NE
.IP
Normally (but see the discussion of \fBon2Clicks\fP, etc):
.RS
.bP
Double-clicking selects by words.
.bP
Triple-clicking
selects by lines.
.bP
Quadruple-clicking goes back to characters, etc.
.RE
.IP
Multiple-click is determined by the time from button up to
button down, so you can change the selection unit in the middle of a selection.
Logical words and lines selected by double- or triple-clicking may wrap
across more than one screen line if lines were wrapped by \fI\*n\fP
itself rather than by the application running in the window.
If the key/button bindings specify that an X selection is to be made,
\fI\*n\fP will leave the selected text highlighted for as long as it
is the selection owner.
.
.TP 5
Pointer button two (usually middle)
\*(``types\*('' (\fIpastes\fP) the text from
the given selection, if any,
otherwise from the cut buffer, inserting it as keyboard input:
.NS
~Ctrl ~Meta <Btn2Up>:\fB\fBinsert\-selection\fP\fP(\fBSELECT\fP, \fBCUT_BUFFER0\fP)
.NE
.
.TP 5
Pointer button three (usually right)
\fIextends\fP the current selection.
.NS
~Ctrl ~Meta <Btn3Down>:\fB\fBstart\-extend\fP\fP()
.NE
.IP
(Without loss of generality,
you can swap \*(``right\*('' and \*(``left\*('' everywhere in the rest of this
paragraph.)  If pressed while closer to
the right edge of the selection than the left, it extends/contracts the
right edge of the selection.
If you contract the selection past
the left edge of the selection,
\fI\*n\fP assumes you really meant the left edge,
restores the original selection, then
extends/contracts the left edge of the selection.
Extension starts in the
selection unit mode
that the last selection or extension was performed in; you can multiple-click
to cycle through them.
.
.PP
By cutting and pasting pieces of text without trailing new lines,
you can take text from several places in different windows and form a command
to the shell, for example, or take output from a program and insert it into
your favorite editor.
Since cut buffers are globally shared among different applications,
you may regard each as a \*(``file\*('' whose contents you know.
The terminal emulator and other text programs should be treating it as if it
were a text file, i.e., the text is delimited by new lines.
.
.SS "Scrolling"
.PP
The scroll region displays the position and amount of text currently showing
in the window (highlighted) relative to the amount of text actually saved.
As more text is saved (up to the maximum), the size of the highlighted area
decreases.
.
.PP
Clicking button one with the pointer in the scroll region moves the
adjacent line to the top of the display window.
.
.PP
Clicking button three moves the top line of the display window down to the
pointer position.
.
.PP
Clicking button two moves the display to a position in the saved text
that corresponds to the pointer's position in the scrollbar.
.
.SS "Tektronix Pointer"
.PP
Unlike the VT\fIxxx\fP window,
the Tektronix window does not allow the copying of text.
It does allow Tektronix GIN mode, and in this mode
the cursor will change from an arrow to a cross.
Pressing any key will send that key and the current coordinate of the
cross cursor.
Pressing button one, two, or three
will return the letters \*(``l\*('', \*(``m\*('', and
\*(``r\*('', respectively.
If the \*(``shift\*('' key is pressed when a pointer button is pressed,
the corresponding upper case letter is sent.
To distinguish a pointer button from a key, the high bit of the character is
set (but this is bit is normally stripped unless the terminal mode is RAW;
see
.IR tty (4)
for details).
.
.
.SH SELECT/PASTE
X clients provide select and paste support by responding to requests conveyed
by the X server.
The X server holds data in \*(``atoms\*('' which correspond
to the different types of selection
(\fBPRIMARY\fP, \fBSECONDARY\fP, \fBCLIPBOARD\fP)
as well as the similar cut buffer mechanism
(\fBCUT_BUFFER0\fP to \fBCUT_BUFFER7\fP).
Those are documented in the ICCCM.
.PP
The ICCCM deals with the underlying mechanism for select/paste.
It does not mention \fIhighlighting\fP.
The \fIselection\fP is not the same as \fIhighlighting\fP.
\fI\*N\fP (like many applications) uses highlighting to show you
the currently selected text.
An X application may \fIown\fP a selection,
which allows it to be the source of data copied using a given selection atom
\fI\*N\fP may continue owning a selection after it stops highlighting
(see \fBkeepSelection\fP).
.SS PRIMARY
When configured to use the primary selection (the default),
\fI\*n\fP can provide the selection data in ways
which help to retain character
encoding information as it is pasted.
.PP
The \fBPRIMARY\fP token is a standard X feature, documented in the ICCCM
(\fIInter-Client Communication Conventions Manual\fR),
which states
.RS 3
.PP
The selection named by the atom \fBPRIMARY\fP is used for all commands
that take only a single argument and is the principal means of
communication between clients that use the selection mechanism.
.RE
.PP
A user \*(``selects\*('' text on \fI\*n\fP, which highlights the selected text.
A subsequent \*(``paste\*('' to another client forwards
a request to the client owning the selection.
If \fI\*n\fP owns the primary selection, it makes the data
available in the form of one or more \*(``selection targets\*(''.
If it does not own the primary selection,
e.g., if it has released it or another client has
asserted ownership, it relies on cut-buffers to pass the data.
But cut-buffers handle only ISO-8859-1 data
(officially \- some clients ignore the rules).
.
.SS CLIPBOARD
.PP
When configured to use the clipboard
(using the \fBselectToClipboard\fP resource),
the problem with persistence of ownership is bypassed.
Otherwise, there is no difference regarding the data which can be
passed via selection.
.PP
The \fBselectToClipboard\fP resource is a compromise,
allowing \fBCLIPBOARD\fP to be treated almost like \fBPRIMARY\fP,
unlike the ICCCM, which describes \fBCLIPBOARD\fP in different terms
than \fBPRIMARY\fP or \fBSECONDARY\fP.
Its lengthy explanation begins with the essential points:
.RS 3
.PP
The selection named by the atom CLIPBOARD is used to hold data
that is being transferred between clients,
that is, data that usually is being cut and then pasted
or copied and then pasted.
Whenever a client wants to transfer data to the clipboard:
.bP
It should assert ownership of the CLIPBOARD.
.bP
If it succeeds in acquiring ownership,
it should be prepared to respond to a request for the contents of the CLIPBOARD
in the usual way (retaining the data to be able to return it).
The request may be generated by the clipboard client described below.
.RE
.SS SELECT
.PP
However, many applications use \fBCLIPBOARD\fP in imitation of other windowing
systems.
The \fBselectToClipboard\fP resource (and corresponding menu entry
\fBSelect to Clipboard\fP) introduce the \fBSELECT\fP token (known only
to \fI\*n\fP) which chooses between
the \fBPRIMARY\fP and \fBCLIPBOARD\fP tokens.
.PP
Without using this feature, one can use workarounds such as the
\fIxclip\fP program to show the contents of the X clipboard within an
\fI\*n\fP window.
.SS SECONDARY
.PP
This is used less often than \fBPRIMARY\fP or \fBCLIPBOARD\fP.
According to the ICCCM, it is used
.bP
As the second argument to commands taking two arguments
(for example, \*(``exchange primary and secondary selections\*('')
.bP
As a means of obtaining data when there is a primary selection
and the user does not want to disturb it
.
.SS Selection Targets
The different types of data which are passed depend on what the receiving
client asks for.
These are termed \fIselection targets\fP.
.PP
When asking for the selection data,
\fI\*n\fP tries the following types in this order:
.RS 5
.TP 5
UTF8_STRING
This is an XFree86 extension, which denotes that the data is encoded in UTF-8.
When \fI\*n\fP is built with wide-character support,
it both accepts and provides this type.
.TP 5
TEXT
the text is in the encoding which corresponds to your current locale.
.TP 5
.\" see xc/doc/specs/CTEXT/ctext.tbl.ms
.\" (it says the data is stored as a type of ISO 2022)
COMPOUND_TEXT
this is a format for multiple character set data, such as multi-lingual text.
It can store UTF-8 data as a special case.
.TP 5
STRING
This is Latin 1 (ISO-8859-1) data.
.RE
.PP
The middle two (TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT) are added if \fI\*n\fP
is configured with the \fBi18nSelections\fP resource set to \*(``true\*(''.
.PP
UTF8_STRING is preferred (therefore first in the list)
since \fI\*n\fP stores text as Unicode data when
running in wide-character mode, and no translation is needed.
On the other hand, TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT may require translation.
If the translation is incomplete, they will insert X's \*(``defaultString\*(''
whose value cannot be set, and may simply be empty.
\fI\*N\fP's \fBdefaultString\fP resource specifies the string to
use for incomplete translations of the UTF8_STRING.
.PP
You can alter the types which \fI\*n\fP tries using the
\fBeightBitSelectTypes\fP or \fButf8SelectTypes\fP resources.
For instance, you might have some specific locale setting
which does not use UTF-8 encoding.
The resource value is a comma-separated list of the selection targets,
which consist of the names shown.
You can use the special name I18N
to denote the optional inclusion of TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT.
The names are matched ignoring case, and can be abbreviated.
The default list can be expressed in several ways, e.g.,
.sp
.RS
.nf
UTF8_STRING,I18N,STRING
utf8,i18n,string
u,i,s
.fi
.RE
.
.SS Mouse Protocol
.PP
Applications can send escape sequences to \fI\*n\fP to cause it to send
escape sequences back to the computer when you press a pointer button,
or even (depending on which escape sequence) send escape sequences back
to the computer as you move the pointer.
.PP
These escape sequences and the responses, called the \fImouse protocol\fP,
are documented in \fIXTerm Control Sequences\fP.
They do not appear in the \fIactions\fP invoked by the \fBtranslations\fP
resource because the resource does not change while you run \fI\*n\fP,
whereas applications can change the mouse prototol
(i.e., enable, disable, use different modes).
.PP
However, the mouse protocol is interpreted within the \fIactions\fP
that are usually associated with the pointer buttons.
\fI\*N\fP ignores the mouse protocol in the \fBinsert\-selection\fP action
if the shift-key is pressed at the same time.
It also modifies a few other actions if the shift-key is pressed,
e.g., suppressing the response with the pointer position,
though not eliminating changes to the selected text.
.
.SH MENUS
.
.PP
\fI\*N\fP has four menus, named
.IR mainMenu ,
.IR vtMenu ,
.IR fontMenu ,
and
.IR tekMenu .
Each menu pops up under the correct combinations of key and button presses.
Each menu is divided into sections, separated by a horizontal line.
Some menu entries correspond to modes that can be altered.
A check mark appears next to a mode that is currently active.
Selecting one of these modes toggles its state.
Other menu entries are commands;
selecting one of these performs the indicated function.
.PP
All of the menu entries correspond to X actions.
In the list below, the menu label is shown followed by the action's
name in parenthesis.
.
.\" ************************************************************************
.SS "Main Options"
.PP
The \fI\*n\fP \fImainMenu\fP pops up
when the \*(``control\*('' key and pointer button one are pressed in a window.
This menu contains items that apply to
both the VT\fIxxx\fP and Tektronix windows.
There are several sections:
.TP
Commands for managing X events:
.RS
.TP
.B Toolbar\fP (resource \fBtoolbar\fP)
Clicking on the \*(``Toolbar\*('' menu entry hides the toolbar if it is visible,
and shows it if it is not.
.TP
.B Secure Keyboard\fP (resource \fBsecurekbd\fP)
The \fBSecure Keyboard\fP
mode is helpful when typing in passwords or other sensitive data in an
unsecure environment
(see \fBSECURITY\fP below, but read the limitations carefully).
.TP
.B Allow SendEvents\fP (resource \fBallowsends\fP)
Specifies whether or not synthetic key and button events generated using
the X protocol SendEvent request should be interpreted or discarded.
This corresponds to the \fBallowSendEvents\fP resource.
.TP
.B Redraw Window\fP (resource \fBredraw\fP)
Forces the X display to repaint;
useful in some environments.
.RE
.TP
Commands for capturing output:
.RS
.TP
.B Log to File\fP (resource \fBlogging\fP)
Captures text sent to the screen in a log file,
as in the \fB\-l\fP logging option.
.TP
.B Print-All Immediately\fP (resource \fBprint\-immediate\fP)
Invokes the \fBprint\-immediate\fP action,
sending the text of the current window directly to a file,
as specified by the
\fBprintFileImmediate\fP,
\fBprintModeImmediate\fP and
\fBprintOptsImmediate\fP
resources.
.TP
.B Print-All on Error\fP (resource \fBprint\-on\-error\fP)
Invokes the \fBprint\-on\-error\fP action,
which toggles a flag telling \fI\*n\fP that if it exits with an X error,
to send the text of the current window directly to a file,
as specified by the
\fBprintFileOnXError\fP,
\fBprintModeOnXError\fP and
\fBprintOptsOnXError\fP
resources.
.TP
.B Print Window\fP (resource \fBprint\fP)
Sends the text of the current window to the program given in the
\fBprinterCommand\fP resource.
.TP
.B Redirect to Printer\fP (resource \fBprint\-redir\fP)
This sets the \fBprinterControlMode\fR to 0 or 2.
You can use this to turn the printer on as if an application had sent
the appropriate control sequence.
It is also useful for switching the printer
off if an application turns it on without resetting the print control mode.
.TP
.B XHTML Screen Dump\fP (resource \fBdump\-html\fP)
Available only when compiled with screen dump support.
Invokes the \fBdump\-html\fP action.
This creates an XHTML file matching the contents of the current screen,
including the border, internal border, colors and most attributes: bold, italic,
underline, faint, strikeout, reverse; blink is rendered as white-on-red;
double underline is rendered the same as underline since
there is no portable equivalent
in CSS 2.2.

.SH SECURITY
.
.PP
X environments differ in their security consciousness.
.bP
Most servers,
run under \fIxdm\fP,
are capable of using a \*(``magic cookie\*('' authorization
scheme that can provide a reasonable level of security for many people.
If your server is only using a host-based mechanism to control access to
the server (see \fBxhost(__mansuffix__)\fP),
then if you enable access for a host and
other users are also permitted to run clients on that same host,
it is possible that someone can run an application which uses the
basic services of the X protocol to snoop on your activities,
potentially capturing a transcript of everything you type at the keyboard.
.bP
Any process which has access to your X display can manipulate it
in ways that you might not anticipate,
even redirecting your keyboard to itself
and sending events to your application's windows.
This is true even with the \*(``magic cookie\*('' authorization scheme.
While the \fBallowSendEvents\fP provides some protection against
rogue applications tampering with your programs,
guarding against a snooper is harder.
.
.bP
The X input extension for instance allows an application to bypass
all of the other (limited) authorization and security features,
including the GrabKeyboard protocol.
.
.bP
The possibility of an application spying on your keystrokes
is of particular concern when you want to type in a password
or other sensitive data.
The best solution to this problem is to use a better
authorization mechanism than is provided by X.
.PP
Subject to all of these caveats,
a simple mechanism exists for protecting keyboard input in \fI\*n\fP.
.
.PP
The \fI\*n\fP menu (see \fBMENUS\fP above) contains a \fBSecure Keyboard\fP
entry which, when enabled,
attempts to ensure that all keyboard input is directed
\fIonly\fP to \fI\*n\fP (using the GrabKeyboard protocol request).
When an application prompts you for a password
(or other sensitive data), you can enable \fBSecure Keyboard\fP using the
menu, type in the data, and then disable \fBSecure Keyboard\fP using
the menu again.
.bP
This ensures that you know which window is accepting your keystrokes.
.bP
It cannot ensure that there are no processes which have access to your
X display that might be observing the keystrokes as well.
.
.PP
Only one X client at a time can grab the keyboard,
so when you attempt to enable \fBSecure Keyboard\fP it may fail.
In this case, the bell will sound.
If the \fBSecure Keyboard\fP succeeds,
the foreground and background colors will be exchanged (as if you
selected the \fBEnable Reverse Video\fP entry in the \fBModes\fP menu);
they will be exchanged again when you exit secure mode.
If the colors
do \fInot\fP switch, then
you should be \fIvery\fP suspicious that you are being spoofed.
If the application you are running displays a prompt before asking for
the password, it is safest to enter secure mode \fIbefore\fP the
prompt gets displayed, and to make sure that the prompt gets displayed
correctly (in the new colors), to minimize the probability of
spoofing.
You can also bring up the menu again and make sure that a check
mark appears next to the entry.
.
.PP
\fBSecure Keyboard\fP mode will be disabled automatically if your \fI\*n\fP
window becomes iconified (or otherwise unmapped), or if you start up
a reparenting window manager (that places a title bar or other decoration
around the window) while in \fBSecure Keyboard\fP mode.
(This is a
feature of the X protocol not easily overcome.)  When this happens,
the foreground and background colors will be switched back and the bell
will sound in warning.
.

(e.g., letters, white space, punctuation) to be selected as a \*(``word\*(''.
Since different people have different preferences for what should
be selected (for example, should filenames be selected as a whole or only
the separate subnames), the default mapping can be overridden through the use
of the \fBcharClass\fP (class \fICharClass\fP) resource.
.
.PP
This resource is a
series of comma-separated
\fIrange\fP:\fIvalue\fP pairs.
.bP
The
\fIrange\fP is either a single number or \fIlow\fP-\fIhigh\fP in the range of 0
to 65535, corresponding to the code for the character or characters to be
set.
.bP
The \fIvalue\fP is arbitrary.
For example, the default table uses the
character number of the first character occurring in the set.
When not in
UTF-8 mode, only the first 256 entries of this table will be used.
.
.PP
The default table starts as follows \-

static int charClass[256] = {

For example, the string \*(``33:48,37:48,45\-47:48,38:48\*('' indicates that the
exclamation mark, percent sign, dash, period, slash, and ampersand characters
should be treated the same way as characters and numbers.
This is useful
for cutting and pasting electronic mailing addresses and filenames.

.SH KEY BINDINGS
.PP
It is possible to rebind keys (or sequences of keys) to arbitrary strings
for input, by changing the \fBtranslations\fP resources
for the vt100 or tek4014 widgets.
Changing the \fBtranslations\fP resource
for events other than key and button events is not expected,
and will cause unpredictable behavior.
.SS Actions
The following
actions are provided for use within the \fIvt100\fP or \fItek4014\fP
\fBtranslations\fP resources:
.TP 8
.B "allow\-bold\-fonts(\fIon/off/toggle\fP)"
This action sets, unsets or toggles the \fBallowBoldFonts\fP resource
and is also invoked by the \fBallow\-bold\-fonts\fP entry in \fIfontMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "allow\-color\-ops(\fIon/off/toggle\fP)"
This action sets, unsets or toggles the \fBallowColorOps\fP resource and is also
invoked by the \fBallow\-color\-ops\fP entry in \fIfontMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "allow\-font\-ops(\fIon/off/toggle\fP)"
This action sets, unsets or toggles the \fBallowFontOps\fP resource and is also
invoked by the \fBallow\-font\-ops\fP entry in \fIfontMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "allow\-mouse\-ops(\fIon/off/toggle\fP)"
This action sets, unsets or toggles the \fBallowMousepOps\fP resource
and is also invoked by the \fBallow\-mouse\-ops\fP entry in \fIfontMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "allow\-send\-events(\fIon/off/toggle\fP)"
This action sets, unsets or toggles the \fBallowSendEvents\fP resource
and is also invoked by the \fBallowsends\fP entry in \fImainMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "allow\-tcap\-ops(\fIon/off/toggle\fP)"
This action sets, unsets or toggles the \fBallowTcapOps\fP resource
and is also invoked by the \fBallow\-tcap\-ops\fP entry in \fIfontMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "allow\-title\-ops(\fIon/off/toggle\fP)"
This action sets, unsets or toggles the \fBallowTitleOps\fP resource
and is also invoked by the \fBallow\-title\-ops\fP entry in \fIfontMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "allow\-window\-ops(\fIon/off/toggle\fP)"
This action sets, unsets or toggles the \fBallowWindowOps\fP resource
and is also invoked by the \fBallow\-window\-ops\fP entry in \fIfontMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "alt\-sends\-escape()"
This action toggles the state of the \fBaltSendsEscape\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "bell([\fIpercent\fP])"
This action rings the keyboard bell at the specified percentage
above or below the base volume.
.TP 8
.B "clear\-saved\-lines()"
This action does \fBhard\-reset()\fP and also clears the history
of lines saved off the top of the screen.
It is also invoked from the \fBclearsavedlines\fP entry in \fIvtMenu\fP.
The effect is identical to a hardware reset (RIS) control sequence.
.TP 8
.B "copy\-selection(\fIdestname\fP [, \&...\&])"
This action puts the currently selected text into all of the selections or
cutbuffers specified by \fIdestname\fP.
Unlike \fBselect\-end\fP, it does not send a mouse position or otherwise
modify the internal selection state.
.TP 8
.B "create\-menu(\fIm/v/f/t\fP)"
This action creates one of the menus used by \fI\*n\fP,
if it has not been previously created.
The parameter values are the menu names:
\fImainMenu\fP, \fIvtMenu\fP, \fIfontMenu\fP, \fItekMenu\fP, respectively.
.TP 8
.B "dabbrev\-expand()"
Expands the word before cursor by searching in the preceding text on the
screen and in the scrollback buffer for words starting with that
abbreviation.
Repeating \fBdabbrev\-expand()\fP several times in sequence searches for an
alternative expansion by looking farther back.
Lack of more matches is signaled by a bell.
Attempts to expand an empty word
(i.e., when cursor is preceded by a space) yield successively all previous
words.
Consecutive identical expansions are ignored.
The word here is defined as a sequence of non-whitespace characters.
This feature partially emulates the behavior
of \*(``dynamic abbreviation\*('' expansion in Emacs (bound there to M\-/).
Here is a resource setting for \fI\*n\fP which will do the same thing:
.NS
*VT100*translations:    #override \\n\\\&
        Meta <KeyPress> /:\fBdabbrev\-expand\fP()
.NE
.TP 8
.B "deiconify()"
Changes the window state back to normal, if it was iconified.
.TP 8
.B "delete\-is\-del()"
This action toggles the state of the \fBdeleteIsDEL\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "dired\-button()"
Handles a button event (other than press and release)
by echoing the event's position
(i.e., character line and column) in the following format:
.NS
^X ESC G <line+\*(`` \*(''> <col+\*(`` \*(''>
.NE
.TP 8
.B "dump\-html()"
Invokes the \fBXHTML Screen Dump\fP feature.
.TP 8
.B "dump\-svg()"
Invokes the \fBSVG Screen Dump\fP feature.
.TP 8
.B "exec\-formatted(\fIformat\fP, \fIsourcename\fP [, \&...\&])"
Execute an external command,
using the current selection for part of the command's parameters.
The first parameter, \fIformat\fP gives the basic command.
Succeeding parameters specify the selection source
as in \fBinsert\-selection\fP.
.IP
The \fIformat\fP parameter allows these substitutions:
.RS
.TP 5
%%
inserts a "%".
.TP 5
%P
the screen-position at the beginning of the highlighted region,
as a semicolon-separated pair of integers using the
values that the CUP control sequence would use.
.TP 5
%p
the screen-position after the beginning of the highlighted region,
using the same convention as \*(``%P\*(''.
.TP 5
%S
the length of the string that \*(``%s\*('' would insert.
.TP 5
%s
the content of the selection, unmodified.
.TP 5
%T
the length of the string that \*(``%t\*('' would insert.
.TP 5
%t
the selection, trimmed of leading/trailing whitespace.
Embedded spaces (and newlines) are copied as is.
.TP 5
%R
the length of the string that \*(``%r\*('' would insert.
.TP 5
%r
the selection, trimmed of trailing whitespace.
.TP 5
%V
the video attributes at the beginning of the highlighted region,
as a semicolon-separated list of integers using the
values that the SGR control sequence would use.
.TP 5
%v
the video attributes after the end of the highlighted region,
using the same convention as \*(``%V\*(''.
.RE
.IP
After constructing the command-string,
\fI\*n\fP forks a subprocess and executes the command,
which completes independently of \fI\*n\fP.
.IP
For example, this translation would invoke a new \fI\*n\fP process
to view a file whose name is selected while holding the shift key down.
The new process is started when the mouse button is released:
.NS
*VT100*translations: #override Shift \\\&
    <Btn1Up>:\fBexec\-formatted\fP("xterm \-e view \*(AQ%t\*(AQ", \fBSELECT\fP)
.NE
.TP 8
.B "exec\-selectable(\fIformat\fP, \fIonClicks\fP)"
Execute an external command,
using data copied from the screen for part of the command's parameters.
The first parameter, \fIformat\fP gives
the basic command as in \fBexec\-formatted\fP.
The second parameter specifies the method for copying
the data as in the \fBon2Clicks\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "fullscreen(\fIon/off/toggle\fP)"
This action sets, unsets or toggles the \fBfullscreen\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "iconify()"
Iconifies the window.
.TP 8
.B "hard\-reset()"
This action resets the scrolling region, tabs, window size, and cursor keys
and clears the screen.
It is also invoked from the \fBhardreset\fP
entry in \fIvtMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "ignore()"
This action ignores the event but checks for special pointer position
escape sequences.
.TP 8
.B "insert()"
This action inserts the character or string associated with
the key that was pressed.
.TP 8
.B "insert\-eight\-bit()"
This action inserts an eight-bit (Meta) version of the character or string
associated with the key that was pressed.
Only single-byte values are treated specially.
The exact action depends on the value of
the \fBaltSendsEscape\fP and
the \fBmetaSendsEscape\fP and
the \fBeightBitInput\fP resources.
The \fBmetaSendsEscape\fP resource is tested first.
See the \fBeightBitInput\fP resource for a full discussion.
.IP
The term \*(``eight-bit\*('' is misleading:
\fI\*n\fP checks if the key is in the range 128 to 255
(the eighth bit is set).
If the value is in that range,
depending on the resource values,
\fI\*n\fP may then do one of the following:
.RS
.bP
add 128 to the value, setting its eighth bit,
.bP
send an ESC byte before the key, or
.bP
send the key unaltered.
.RE
.TP 8
.B "insert\-formatted(\fIformat\fP, \fIsourcename\fP [, \&...\&])"
Insert the current selection or data related to it, formatted.
The first parameter, \fIformat\fP gives the template for the data
as in \fBexec\-formatted\fP.
Succeeding parameters specify the selection source
as in \fBinsert\-selection\fP.
.TP 8
.B "insert\-selectable(\fIformat\fP, \fIonClicks\fP)"
Insert data copied from the screen, formatted.
The first parameter, \fIformat\fP gives the template for the data
as in \fBexec\-formatted\fP.
The second parameter specifies the method for copying
the data as in the \fBon2Clicks\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "insert\-selection(\fIsourcename\fP [, \&...\&])"
This action inserts the string found in the selection or cutbuffer indicated
by \fIsourcename\fP.
Sources are checked in the order given (case is
significant) until one is found.
Commonly-used selections include:
\fBPRIMARY\fP, \fBSECONDARY\fP, and \fBCLIPBOARD\fP.
Cut buffers are
typically named \fBCUT_BUFFER0\fP through \fBCUT_BUFFER7\fP.
.TP 8
.B "insert\-seven\-bit()"
This action is a synonym for \fBinsert()\fP.
The term \*(``seven-bit\*('' is misleading:
it only implies that \fI\*n\fP does not try to add 128 to the key's value
as in \fBinsert\-eight\-bit()\fP.
.TP 8
.B "interpret(\fIcontrol-sequence\fP)"
Interpret the given control sequence locally, i.e., without passing it to
the host.
This works by inserting the control sequence at the front
of the input buffer.
Use \*(``\\\*('' to escape octal digits in the string.
Xt does not allow you to put a null character
(i.e., \*(``\\000\*('') in the string.
.TP 8
.B "keymap(\fIname\fP)"
This action dynamically defines a new translation table whose resource
name is \fIname\fP with the suffix \*(``\fIKeymap\fP\*(''
(i.e., \fIname\fP\fBKeymap\fP, where case is significant).
The name \fINone\fP restores the original translation table.
.TP 8
.B "larger\-vt\-font()"
Set the font to the next larger one, based on the font dimensions.
See also \fBset\-vt\-font()\fP.
.TP 8
.B "load\-vt\-fonts(\fIname\fP[,\fIclass\fP])"
Load fontnames from the given subresource name and class.
That is, load the \*(``*VT100.\fIname\fP.font\*('',
resource as \*(``*VT100.font\*('' etc.
If no name is given, the original set of fontnames is restored.
.IP
Unlike \fBset\-vt\-font()\fR, this does not affect the escape- and select-fonts,
since those are not based on resource values.
It does affect the fonts loosely organized under the \*(``Default\*('' menu
entry, including \fBfont\fP, \fBboldFont\fP, \fBwideFont\fP
and \fBwideBoldFont\fP.
.TP 8
.B "maximize()"
Resizes the window to fill the screen.
.TP 8
.B "meta\-sends\-escape()"
This action toggles the state of the \fBmetaSendsEscape\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "pointer\-button()"
Use this action as a fall-back to handle button press- and release-events
for the mouse control sequence protocol
when the selection-related translations are suppressed with the
\fBomitTranslation\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "pointer\-motion()"
Use this action as a fall-back to handle motion-events
for the mouse control sequence protocol
when the selection-related translations are suppressed with the
\fBomitTranslation\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "popup\-menu(\fImenuname\fP)"
This action displays the specified popup menu.
Valid names (case is
significant) include:  \fImainMenu\fP, \fIvtMenu\fP, \fIfontMenu\fP,
and \fItekMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "print(\fIprinter\-flags\fP)"
This action prints the window.
It is also invoked by the \fBprint\fP entry in \fImainMenu\fP.
.IP
The action accepts optional parameters, which temporarily override
resource settings.
The parameter values are matched ignoring case:
.RS
.TP 5
noFormFeed
no form feed will be sent at the end of the last line printed
(i.e., \fBprinterFormFeed\fP is \*(``false\*('').
.TP 5
FormFeed
a form feed will be sent at the end of the last line printed
(i.e., \fBprinterFormFeed\fP is \*(``true\*('').
.TP 5
noNewLine
no newline will be sent at the end of the last line printed,
and wrapped lines will be combined into long lines
(i.e., \fBprinterNewLine\fP is \*(``false\*('').
.TP 5
NewLine
a newline will be sent at the end of the last line printed,
and each line will be limited (by adding a newline) to the screen width
(i.e., \fBprinterNewLine\fP is \*(``true\*('').
.TP 5
noAttrs
the page is printed without attributes
(i.e., \fBprintAttributes\fP is \*(``0\*('').
.TP 5
monoAttrs
the page is printed with monochrome (vt220) attributes
(i.e., \fBprintAttributes\fP is \*(``1\*('').
.TP 5
colorAttrs
the page is printed with ANSI color attributes
(i.e., \fBprintAttributes\fP is \*(``2\*('').
.RE
.TP 8
.B "print\-everything(\fIprinter\-flags\fP)"
This action sends the entire text history, in addition to the text
currently visible, to the program given in the \fBprinterCommand\fP resource.
It allows the same optional parameters as the \fBprint\fP action.
With a suitable printer command, the action can be used to load the text
history in an editor.
.TP 8
.B "print\-immediate()"
Sends the text of the current window directly to a file,
as specified by the
\fBprintFileImmediate\fP,
\fBprintModeImmediate\fP and
\fBprintOptsImmediate\fP
resources.
.TP 8
.B "print\-on\-error()"
Toggles a flag telling \fI\*n\fP that if it exits with an X error,
to send the text of the current window directly to a file,
as specified by the
\fBprintFileOnXError\fP,
\fBprintModeOnXError\fP and
\fBprintOptsOnXError\fP
resources.
.TP 8
.B "print\-redir()"
This action toggles the \fBprinterControlMode\fR between 0 and 2.
The corresponding popup menu entry is useful for switching the printer
off if you happen to change your mind after deciding to print random
binary files on the terminal.
.TP 8
.B "quit()"
.br
This action sends a SIGHUP to the subprogram and exits.
It is also invoked
by the \fBquit\fP entry in \fImainMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "readline\-button()"
Supports the optional readline feature by echoing repeated cursor forward
or backward control sequences on button release event,
to request that the host application update its notion of the cursor's
position to match the button event.
.TP 8
.B "redraw()"
This action redraws the window.
It is also invoked by the \fBredraw\fP entry in \fImainMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "restore()"
Restores the window to the size before it was last maximized.
.TP 8
.B "scroll\-back(\fIcount\fP [,\fIunits\fP [,\fImouse\fP] ])"
This action scrolls the text window backward so that text that had previously
scrolled off the top of the screen is now visible.
.IP
The \fIcount\fP argument
indicates the number of \fIunits\fP (which may be \fIpage\fP, \fIhalfpage\fP,
\fIpixel\fP, or \fIline\fP) by which to scroll.
If no \fIcount\fP parameter is given, \fI\*n\fP uses the number of lines
given by the \fBscrollLines\fP resource.
.IP
An adjustment can be specified for the \fIpage\fP or \fIhalfpage\fP units
by appending a \*(``+\*('' or \*(``\-\*(''
sign followed by a number,
e.g., \fIpage\-2\fP to specify 2 lines less than a page.
.IP
If the second parameter is omitted \*(``lines\*('' is used.
.IP
If the third parameter \fImouse\fP is given, the action is ignored when
mouse reporting is enabled.
.TP 8
.B "scroll\-forw(\fIcount\fP [,\fIunits\fP [,\fImouse\fP] ])"
This action is similar to \fBscroll\-back\fP except that it scrolls
in the other direction.

Here is an example which uses shifted select/paste to copy to the clipboard,
and unshifted select/paste for the primary selection.
In each case, a (different) cut buffer is
also a target or source of the select/paste operation.
It is important to remember however,
that cut buffers store data in ISO-8859-1 encoding,
while selections can store data in a variety of formats and encodings.
While \fI\*n\fP owns the selection, it highlights it.
When it loses the selection, it removes the corresponding highlight.

.NE
.PP
In the example, the class name \fBVT100\fP is used rather than the widget name.
These are different; a class name could apply to more than one widget.
A leading \*(``*\*('' is used because the widget hierarchy above the
\fIvt100\fP widget depends on
whether the toolbar support is compiled into \fI\*n\fP.
.PP
Most of the predefined translations are related to the mouse,
with a few that use some of the special keys on the keyboard.
Applications use special keys (function-keys, cursor-keys, keypad-keys)
with modifiers (shift, control, alt).
If \fI\*n\fP defines a translation for a given combination of
special key and modifier, that makes it unavailable for use
by applications within the terminal.
For instance, one might extend the use of \fIPage Up\fP and \fIPage Down\fP
keys seen here:
.NS
    Shift <KeyPress> Prior : \fBscroll\-back\fP(1,halfpage) \\n\\\&
    Shift <KeyPress> Next  : \fBscroll\-forw\fP(1,halfpage) \\n\\\&
.NE
.PP
to the \fIHome\fP and \fIEnd\fP keys:
.NS
    Shift <KeyPress> Home : \fBscroll\-to\fP(begin) \\n\\\&
    Shift <KeyPress> End  : \fBscroll\-to\fP(end)
.NE
.PP
but then shift\-\fIHome\fP and shift\-\fIEnd\fP would then
be unavailable to applications.
.PP
Not everyone finds the three-button mouse bindings easy to use.
In a wheel mouse, the middle button might be the wheel.
As an alternative, you could add a binding using shifted keys:
.NS
*VT100*translations:      #override \\n\\\&
    Shift <Key>Home:    \fBcopy\-selection\fP(\fBSELECT\fP) \\n\\\&
    Shift <Key>Insert:  \fBcopy\-selection\fP(\fBSELECT\fP) \\n\\\&
    Ctrl Shift <Key>C:  \fBcopy\-selection\fP(\fBSELECT\fP) \\n\\\&
    Ctrl Shift <Key>V:  \fBinsert\-selection\fP(\fBSELECT\fP)
.NE
.PP
You would still use the left- and right-mouse buttons (typically 1 and 3)
for beginning and extending selections.
.PP
Besides mouse problems, there are also keyboards with inconvenient layouts.
Some lack a numeric keypad, making it hard to use the shifted keypad plus
and minus bindings for switching between font sizes.
You can work around that by assigning the actions to more readily accessed
keys:
.NS
*VT100*translations:      #override \\n\\\&
    Ctrl <Key> +:       \fBlarger\-vt\-font\fP() \\n\\\&
    Ctrl <Key> \-:       \fBsmaller\-vt\-font\fP()
.NE
.PP
The keymap feature allows you to switch between sets of translations.
The sample below shows
how the \fBkeymap()\fP action may be used to add special
keys for entering commonly-typed words:
.NS
*VT100.Translations: #override <Key>F13: keymap(dbx)
*VT100.dbxKeymap.translations: \\\&
        <Key>F14:       \fBkeymap\fP(None) \\n\\\&
        <Key>F17:       \fBstring\fP("next") \\n\\\&
                        \fBstring\fP(0x0d) \\n\\\&
        <Key>F18:       \fBstring\fP("step") \\n\\\&
                        \fBstring\fP(0x0d) \\n\\\&
        <Key>F19:       \fBstring\fP("continue") \\n\\\&
                        \fBstring\fP(0x0d) \\n\\\&
        <Key>F20:       \fBstring\fP("print ") \\n\\\&
                        \fBinsert\-selection\fP(\fBPRIMARY\fP, \fBCUT_BUFFER0\fP)
.NE
.SS Default Scrollbar Bindings
.PP
Key bindings are normally associated with the \fIvt100\fP or \fItek4014\fP
widgets which act as terminal emulators.
\fI\*N\fP's scrollbar (and toolbar if it is configured) are separate widgets.
Because all of these use the X Toolkit,
they have corresponding \fBtranslations\fP resources.
Those resources are distinct,
and match different patterns, e.g., the differences in widget-name and
number of levels of widgets which they may contain.
.PP
The \fIscrollbar\fP widget is a child of the \fIvt100\fP widget.
It is positioned on top of the \fIvt100\fP widget.
Toggling the scrollbar on and off causes the \fIvt100\fP widget to resize.
.PP
The default bindings for the scrollbar widget use only mouse-button events:
.NS
   <Btn5Down>: StartScroll(Forward) \\n\\\&
   <Btn1Down>: StartScroll(Forward) \\n\\\&
   <Btn2Down>: StartScroll(Continuous) MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \\n\\\&
   <Btn3Down>: StartScroll(Backward) \\n\\\&
   <Btn4Down>: StartScroll(Backward) \\n\\\&
   <Btn2Motion>: MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \\n\\\&
   <BtnUp>:    NotifyScroll(Proportional) EndScroll()
.NE
.PP
Events which the \fIscrollbar\fP widget does not recognize at all are lost.
.PP
However, at startup, \fI\*n\fP augments these translations with the default
translations used for the \fIvt100\fP widget,
together with the resource \*(``actions\*('' which those translations use.
Because the \fIscrollbar\fP (or \fImenubar\fP) widgets do not recognize these
actions (but because it has a corresponding translation),
they are passed on to the \fIvt100\fP widget.
.PP
This augmenting of the scrollbar's translations has a few limitations:
.bP
\fI\*N\fP knows what the default translations are,
but there is no suitable library interface for determining what
customizations a user may have added to the \fIvt100\fP widget.
All that \fI\*n\fP can do is augment the \fIscrollbar\fP widget to
give it the same starting point for further customization by the user.
.bP
Events in the gap between the widgets may be lost.
.bP
Compose sequences begun in one widget cannot be completed in the other,
because the input methods for each widget do not share context information.
.PP
Most customizations of the scrollbar translations do not concern key bindings.
Rather, users are generally more interested in changing the bindings of the
mouse buttons.
For example, some people prefer using the left pointer button
for dragging the scrollbar thumb.
That can be set up by altering the translations resource, e.g.,
.NS
*VT100.scrollbar.translations:  #override \\n\\\&
   <Btn5Down>:     StartScroll(Forward) \\n\\\&
   <Btn1Down>:     StartScroll(Continuous) MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \\n\\\&
   <Btn4Down>:     StartScroll(Backward) \\n\\\&
   <Btn1Motion>:   MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \\n\\\&
   <BtnUp>:        NotifyScroll(Proportional) EndScroll()
.NE
.SH "CONTROL SEQUENCES AND KEYBOARD"
Applications can send sequences of characters to the terminal to change its
behavior.
Often they are referred to as
\*(``ANSI escape sequences\*('' or just plain
\*(``escape sequences\*('' but both terms are misleading:
.bP
ANSI x3.64 (obsolete) which was replaced by ISO 6429 (ECMA-48) gave rules
for the \fIformat\fP of these sequences of characters.
.bP
While the original VT100 was claimed to be ANSI-compatible (against x3.64),
there is no freely available version of the ANSI standard to show where
the VT100 differs.
Most of the documents which mention the ANSI standard have
additions not found in the original (such as those
based on \fBansi.sys\fP).
So this discussion focuses on the ISO standards.
.bP
The standard describes only sequences sent from the host to the terminal.
There is no standard for sequences sent by special keys from the terminal
to the host.
By convention (and referring to existing terminals), the format of those
sequences usually conforms to the host-to-terminal standard.
.bP
Some of \fI\*n\fP's sequences do not fit into the standard scheme.
Technically those are \*(``unspecified\*(''.
As an example,
DEC Screen Alignment Test (DECALN) is this three-character sequence:
.NS
\fIESC\fP # 8
.NE
.PP
.bP
Some sequences fit into the standard format,
but are not listed in the standard.
These include the sequences used for setting up scrolling margins
and doing forward/reverse scrolling.
.bP
Some of the sequences (in particular, the single-character functions
such as tab and backspace)
do not include the \fIescape\fP character.
.PP
With all of that in mind, the standard refers to these sequences of
characters as \*(``control sequences\*(''.
.PP
\fI\*N Control Sequences\fP lists the control sequences which
an application can send \fI\*n\fP to make it perform various operations.
Most of these operations are standardized, from either the DEC or Tektronix
terminals, or from more widely used standards such as ISO-6429.
.PP
A few examples of usage are given in this section.
.SS Window and Icon Titles
.PP
Some scripts use \fBecho\fP with options \fB\-e\fP and \fB\-n\fP to tell
the shell to interpret the string \*(``\\e\*('' as
the \fIescape\fP character and
to suppress a trailing newline on output.
Those are not portable, nor recommended.
Instead, use \fBprintf\fP (POSIX).
.PP
For example, to set the \fIwindow title\fP to \*(``Hello world!\*('',
you could use one of these commands in a script:
.NS
printf \*(AQ\\033]2;Hello world!\\033\\\*(AQ
printf \*(AQ\\033]2;Hello world!\\007\*(AQ
printf \*(AQ\\033]2;%s\\033\\\*(AQ "Hello world!"
printf \*(AQ\\033]2;%s\\007\*(AQ "Hello world!"
.NE
.PP
The \fBprintf\fP command interprets the octal value \*(``\\033\*('' for
\fIescape\fP, and (since it was not given in the format) omits a trailing
newline from the output.
.PP
Some programs (such as \fBscreen\fP(1)) set both window- and icon-titles
at the same time, using a slightly different control sequence:
.NS
printf \*(AQ\\033]0;Hello world!\\033\\\*(AQ
printf \*(AQ\\033]0;Hello world!\\007\*(AQ
printf \*(AQ\\033]0;%s\\033\\\*(AQ "Hello world!"
printf \*(AQ\\033]0;%s\\007\*(AQ "Hello world!"
.NE
.PP
The difference is the \fIparameter\fP \*(``0\*('' in each command.
Most window managers will honor either window title or icon title.
Some will make a distinction and allow you to set just the icon title.
You can tell \fI\*n\fP to ask for this with a different parameter
in the control sequence:
.NS
printf \*(AQ\\033]1;Hello world!\\033\\\*(AQ
printf \*(AQ\\033]1;Hello world!\\007\*(AQ
printf \*(AQ\\033]1;%s\\033\\\*(AQ "Hello world!"
printf \*(AQ\\033]1;%s\\007\*(AQ "Hello world!"
.NE
.
.SS Special Keys
.PP
\fI\*N\fP, like any VT100-compatible terminal emulator,
has two modes for the \fIspecial keys\fP (cursor-keys, numeric keypad,
and certain function-keys):
.bP
\fInormal mode\fP, which makes the special keys transmit
\*(``useful\*('' sequences such as the control sequence for cursor-up
when pressing the up-arrow, and
.bP
\fIapplication mode\fP,
which uses a different control sequence that cannot be mistaken for
the
\*(``useful\*('' sequences.
.PP
The main difference between the two modes is that normal mode sequences
start with \fICSI\fP (\fIescape\ [\fP) and application mode sequences
start with \fISS3\fP (\fIescape\ O\fP).
.PP
The terminal is initialized into one of these two modes (usually the
normal mode), based on the terminal description (termcap or terminfo).
The terminal description also has capabilities (strings) defined for
the keypad mode used in curses applications.
.PP
There is a problem in using the terminal description for applications
that are not intended to be full-screen curses applications:
the definitions of special keys are only correct for this keypad mode.
For example, some shells
(unlike \fBksh\fP(1), which appears to be hard-coded, not even using termcap)
allow their users to customize key-bindings,
assigning shell actions to special keys.
.bP
\fBbash\fP(1) allows \fIconstant\fP strings to be assigned
to functions.
This is only successful if the terminal is initialized to application
mode by default,
because \fBbash\fP lacks flexibility in this area.
It uses a (less expressive than \fBbash\fP's)
\fBreadline\fP scripting language for setting up key bindings,
which relies upon the user to statically enumerate the possible bindings for
given values of \fB$TERM\fP.
.bP
\fBzsh\fP(1) provides an analogous feature,
but it accepts runtime expressions,
as well as providing a \fB$terminfo\fP array for scripts.
In particular, one can use the terminal database,
transforming when defining a key-binding.
By transforming the output so that \fICSI\fP and \fISS3\fP are equated,
\fBzsh\fP can use the terminal database to obtain useful definitions
for its command-line use regardless of whether the terminal uses
normal or application mode initially.
Here is an example:
.NS
[[ "$terminfo[kcuu1]" == "^[O"* ]] && \\\&
bindkey \-M viins "${terminfo[kcuu1]/O/[}" \\\&
vi\-up\-line\-or\-history
.NE
.
.
.SS Changing Colors
.PP
A few shell programs provide the ability for users to add color and other
video attributes to the shell prompt strings.
Users can do this by setting \fB$PS1\fP (the primary prompt string).
Again, \fBbash\fP and \fBzsh\fP have provided features not found in \fBksh\fP.
There is a problem, however: the prompt's width on the screen will not
necessarily be the same as the number of characters.
Because there is no guidance in the POSIX standard, each shell addresses
the problem in a different way:
.bP
\fBbash\fP treats characters within
\*(``\\[\*('' and
\*(``\\]\*(''
as nonprinting (using no width on the screen).
.bP
\fBzsh\fP treats characters within
\*(``%{\*('' and
\*(``%}\*(''
as nonprinting.
.PP
In addition to the difference in syntax,
the shells provide different methods for obtaining useful escape sequences:
.bP
As noted in \fBSpecial Keys\fP, \fBzsh\fP initializes the $terminfo array
with the terminal capabilities.
.IP
It also provides a function \fBechoti\fP which works like \fBtput\fP(1)
to convert a terminal capability with its parameters into a string
that can be written to the terminal.
.bP
Shells lacking a comparable feature (such as \fBbash\fP) can always
use the program \fBtput\fP to do this transformation.
.PP
Hard-coded escape sequences are supported by each shell,
but are not recommended because those rely upon particular configurations
and cannot be easily moved between different user environments.
.
.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
\fI\*N\fP sets several environment variables.
.SS System Independent
.PP
Some variables are used on every system:
.TP 5
.B DISPLAY
is the display name,
pointing to the X server (see \fIDISPLAY NAMES\fP in X(__miscmansuffix__)).
.TP 5
.B TERM
.br
is set according to the terminfo (or termcap) entry which it is using as
a reference.
.IP
On some systems, you may encounter situations where the shell which you
use and \fI\*n\fP are built using libraries with different terminal databases.
In that situation, \fI\*n\fP may choose a terminal description not known
to the shell.
.TP 5
.B WINDOWID
is set to the X window id number of the \fI\*n\fP window.
.TP 5
.B XTERM_FILTER
is set if a locale-filter is used.
The value is the pathname of the filter.
.TP 5
.B XTERM_LOCALE
shows the locale which was used by \fI\*n\fP on startup.
Some shell initialization scripts may set a different locale.
.TP 5
.B XTERM_SHELL
is set to the pathname of the program which is invoked.
Usually that is a shell program, e.g., \fI/bin/sh\fP.
Since it is not necessarily a shell program however,
it is distinct from \*(``SHELL\*(''.
.TP 5
.B XTERM_VERSION
is set to the string displayed by the \fB\-version\fP option.
That is normally an identifier for the X Window libraries used to
build \fI\*n\fP, followed by
\fI\*n\fP's patch number in parenthesis.
The patch number is also part of the response to a Secondary Device Attributes
(DA) control sequence (see \fIXterm Control Sequences\fP).
.
.SS System Dependent
.
.PP
Depending on your system configuration, \fI\*n\fP may also set the
following:
.TP 5
.B COLUMNS
the width of the \fI\*n\fP in characters (cf: \*(``stty columns\*('').
.IP
When this variable is set, \fIcurses\fP applications (and most
terminal programs) will assume that the terminal has this many columns.
.IP
\fI\*N\fP would do this for systems which have no ability
to tell the size of the terminal.
Those are very rare, none newer than the mid 1990s when SVR4 became prevalent.
.TP 5
.B HOME
.br
when \fI\*n\fP is configured (at build-time) to update utmp.
.TP 5
.B LINES
the height of the \fI\*n\fP in characters (cf: \*(``stty rows\*('').
.IP
When this variable is set, \fIcurses\fP applications (and most
terminal programs) will assume that the terminal has this many lines (rows).
.IP
\fI\*N\fP would do this for systems which have no ability
to tell the size of the terminal.
Those are very rare, none newer than the mid 1990s when SVR4 became prevalent.
.TP 5
.B LOGNAME
when \fI\*n\fP is configured (at build-time) to update utmp.
.IP
Your configuration may have set \fBLOGNAME\fP; \fI\*n\fP does not modify that.
If it is unset, \fI\*n\fP will use \fBUSER\fP if it is set.
Finally, if neither is set, \fI\*n\fP will use the \fBgetlogin\fP(3) function.
.TP 5
.B SHELL
when \fI\*n\fP is configured (at build-time) to update utmp.
It is also set if you provide a valid shell name as the optional parameter.
.IP
\fI\*N\fP sets this to an absolute pathname.
If you have set the variable to a relative pathname,
\fI\*n\fP may set it to a different shell pathname.
.IP
If you have set this to an pathname which does not correspond to a valid
shell, \fI\*n\fP may unset it, to avoid confusion.
.TP 5
.B TERMCAP
the contents of the termcap entry corresponding to \fB$TERM\fP,
with lines and columns values substituted
for the actual size window you have created.
.IP
This feature is, like \fBLINES\fP and \fBCOLUMNS\fP, used rarely.
It addresses the same limitation of a few older systems
by providing a way for \fItermcap\fP-based applications to get the initial
screen size.
.TP 5
.B TERMINFO
may be defined to a nonstandard location using the configure script.
.\"
.

.SH WINDOW PROPERTIES
.PP
In the output from \fBxprop\fP(1), there are several properties.
.SS Properties set by X Toolkit
.TP 5
.B WM_CLASS
This shows the \fIinstance name\fP and the X resource \fIclass\fP,
passed to X Toolkit during initialization of \fI\*n\fP,
e.g.,
.NS

.NE
.TP 5
.B WM_CLIENT_LEADER

.NE
.TP 5
.B WM_ICON_NAME
This holds the icon title,
which different window managers handle in various ways.
It is set via the \fBiconName\fP resource.
Applications can change this using control sequences.
.TP 5
.B WM_LOCALE_NAME
This shows the result from the \fBsetlocale\fP(3) function

.NE
.IP
in your \&.Xdefaults file to

.SH BUGS
.
.PP
Large pastes do not work on some systems.
This is not a bug in
\fI\*n\fP; it is a bug in the pseudo terminal driver of those
systems.
\fI\*N\fP feeds large pastes to the pty only as fast as the pty
will accept data, but some pty drivers do not return enough information
to know if the write has succeeded.
.
.PP
When connected to an input method, it is possible for \fI\*n\fP to hang
if the XIM server is suspended or killed.
.
.PP
Many of the options are not resettable after \fI\*n\fP starts.
.
.PP
This program still needs to be rewritten.
It should be split into very
modular sections, with the various emulators being completely separate
widgets that do not know about each other.
Ideally, you'd like to be able to
pick and choose emulator widgets and stick them into a single control widget.
.
.PP
There needs to be a dialog box to allow entry of the Tek COPY file name.

EWMH uses \fIUTF8_STRING\fP pervasively without defining it,
but does mention the ICCCM.
Version 2.0 of the ICCCM does not address UTF-8.
That is an extension added in XFree86.
.bP
Markus Kuhn summarized this in
\fIUTF-8 and Unicode FAQ for Unix/Linux\fP (2001),
in the section \*(``Is X11 ready for Unicode?\*(''

.bP
Juliusz Chroboczek proposed the UTF8_STRING selection atom in 1999/2000,
which became part of the ICCCM in XFree86.
.IP
https://www.irif.fr/~jch/software/UTF8_STRING/
.IP
An Xorg developer removed that part of the documentation in 2004
when incorporating other work from XFree86 into Xorg.
The feature is still supported in Xorg, though undocumented as of 2019.
